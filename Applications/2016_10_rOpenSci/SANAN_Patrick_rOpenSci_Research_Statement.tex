% My vision 
% - High performance computing is important, but reproducibility is hard
%  - Presentation is non-standard, people aren't so interested in data analysis
%   - Presentation of robustness is difficult
%    - Work on interfaces to numerical libraries
%     - Work on tools that make it easy to present "interpretable" results.
%      - This is becoming very important, given the complexity of modern hardware. 
%       - I would immediately propose to work with NERSc 
%        - Performance modelling must be included.
%
%         - This embarassment is known, but will never be fixed unless it is very, very easy to do the right thing.
%
%          - I've done some preliminary stuff like this, in the context of this pipelined solvers project

% Goals
% A framework that can be transparently used with common batch systems
% Graphics which automatically produce the sorts of plots seen in Hoefler's paper
% ..
