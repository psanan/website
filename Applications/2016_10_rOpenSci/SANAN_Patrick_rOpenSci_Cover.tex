\opening{Dear rOpenSci Project,}

% ..

% My proposal (summary)

% Why I'm good for this job
% - Passionate about open source and reproducible software. This is a huge problem in science. This "third pillar" is something of an embarrassment.
% - Experience with open source software via PETSc
% - Full stack experience
% - Very flexible person, who likes a fast-paced environment and can grasp and solve problems quickly (but also can take the longer pace of real research)
%- Lots of contacts: LBL/NERSC, CSCS, Argonne

% Why I'm qualified
% Additional Qualifications (required by start date):

%Candidates should have no more than three years of research experience since receipt of Ph.D. at start of appointment.
%
%Demonstrated record of writing and publishing manuscripts and/or reports.
%
%Demonstrated experience collaborating with other researchers.
%
%Experience and/or knowledge of sustainable software and reproducible research.
%
%Capacity for innovation and demonstrated ability to think outside of current paradigms.
%
%Additional Preferred Qualifications:
%
%Experience teaching and translating complex material/research to broad, non-technical audiences.
%
%Familiarity with the Open Science Framework, version control with Git, dynamic documents in
%R markdown, and other research transparency tools.
%
%Specialization in causal inference in applied micro-econometrics, research design and program evaluation.
%
%Ability to interact with individuals at all levels of an organization in a fast-paced environment, sometimes under pressure, while remaining flexible, proactive and tactful.
%

% Why this job is good for me
% - I believe that the way to advance science is to make the tools bulletproof. However, the reward mechanisms in academia are bullshit. One is encouraged to produce the largest number of "novel" papers as possible. Nothing is checked, nothing is reproduced, most things aren't used.
% - I have deep understanding of the whole stack and I want to be able to touch many domains of science. Community software is a way to do that!
% - I hope to move on to LBL

\closing{Sincerely,}
\end{letter}
