Questions for Michael Lough



9. Where can I fit in? My expertise is on algorithms, and what I  would hope to do is to bring knowledge and interest in these things to help get the big efficiency gains: that is, those involved in choosing the right algorithm and understanding what deviations from algorithmic optimality are being chosen. 

1. Opportunities to work with algorithms, in particular scalable solvers?

1. Opportunities to work with software?

2. Opportunity to work from Zurich?

3. Opportunities to work in the Bay Area?

4. Opportunities to collaborate with academics?

5. Where have people come from and gone to on the team? Relationships with U.S. national labs?

5. Links with Intel?

5. Opportunity to contribute to open source projects (PETSc)?

6. Nature of team?

7. Overall objectives in exascale push?

8. Links to American policy objectives? (defense, energy,..)

Specifics of what the team does:
- opportunities in algorithms/collaborations to leverage new hardware?
- consulting?
- software dev?
- co-design?
- application testing?

9. Exascale: a race to the future of HPC white paper:

Michael:
Big Bid support:
application support - weather, government agency

What HPE is doing now:
DOE exascale initiative
Gen-Z fabric is the thing they're pushing
 - processor (?) pins with direct connects to the fabric
 - fabric-attached memory
 - prototype system exists

 Want application dev people, new approaches to programming
 Work with people in the DOE labs

 worldwide project, but center of mass is in Colorado and Palo Alto
 - meetings pretty late
 - HPC group

 PathForward - till Feb 2020, procurements in between 2010-2023 timeframe. Full system with interconnect. Work with processor and memory vendors.

 Took over SGI last year - they have systems at NASA, NCAR, etc.

 Co-design project has openings:
  - opening : should I apply

  HP Labs is where Rob works (this is where I might like to work)
  - more forward-looking

Chat w/ Rob in California!
- get his slant on things

HP have a site in Grenoble as well! (people in CH)
