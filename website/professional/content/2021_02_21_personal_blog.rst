Splitting out Personal Blog
===========================

I'm splitting this site into two separate sub-sites. This one will remain
as my "professional" site, and other material will live at a 
`dedicated sub-blog <https://patricksanan.org/personal>`__. 
This is intended to allow different types of readers
to be directed to (and to subscribe to separate feeds for) relevant material.

This means that if you are interested in seeing more posts about running, music,
etc., you should update your bookmarks and/or feed URL.
