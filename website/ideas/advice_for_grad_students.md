Why should I give you advice? I’m not “successful”. Meaning, I’m not on the track to be a professor or a scientific PI. Well, first, because statistically, most of you are like me and might like to hear how someone like you feels, on reflection. Also, grad students with good advisors and mentors get great advice from those people, but those people are “successful”, a massive bias.

## Your Advisor
The biggest advice is to understand what you should expect from your advisor.
Mostly, it's in the name. They are there to give you advice. Hopefully this rises to the level
of mentorship.

But you should not assume that your advisor is your boss, your supervisor, or your manager.
In some cases (I'm imaginging more bench-based work that I have never done, myself) this might
be true. But in the fields I've worked in, it is not.

I used to think that this was because these people were the types of people who had no interest
or talent in being bosses, supervisor, or managers. I don't think that is a very useful viewpoint anymore, though.
Rather, I think that it's just a matter of understanding what your advisor's work life looks like.
It's very different from most bosses/supervisors/managers.

Most of the time, they have too many commitments to give you the full benefit of their talents. They are not superhuman
and, like you, they can probably only think really hard about one thing at a time. If you're very lucky,
that's your project, but that's unusual.

Then there is the whole pyramid structure. This is doubly important to understand. First, it means
that people at level N in academia are outnumbered by those on level N-1, so your advisor has
lots of people to advise. Second, much more darkly, is that it means that the majority of people on level
N-1 don't make it to level N. This makes you, the student or advisee, very unlike the typical employee
that a boss/supervisor/manager manages. You will be gone soon, and if you and half your cohort "fail",
that is not a problem as far as the pyramid is concerned. Only a few can be promoted, and your advisor
doesn't have the bandwidth for all those underlings anyway.

There's a bright side to this, though. Your advisor knows all of this and likely feels bad about it.
They might have been so successful in their career that they were always the "golden child" or "star"
student and never felt neglected or stuck, but it's unlikely that they had such uniform success and
are also so lacking in empathy. That means that you will be rewarded if you take the initiative. Show
your passion for what you're doing, explore, sign up for things.

Also realize that your advisor is not like a boss, but in some ways like you're boss's boss's boss.
They can be very helpful in short sessions, and more importantly they can direct you to other resources.
They can connect you with people (perhaps elsewhere in the local pyramid) and opportunities. They want
you to succeed and believe you can - that's why they hired you - but they can't do it all themselves.

## Finding the Right Problems to Solve

Being a phd student is rough. “It’s the hardest thing you’ll ever do” I was told my first week. I steeled myself, but (like having kids) when people tell you this, you can’t understand. You think it’ll be hard in the way things were before, but just .. more so. I though, on some level, that Id have to solve more difficult math problems. No no no. Finding a hard math problem to solve is the sweet reward for the real work..

## Avoiding Cynicism

It's very easy to do. Most papers published are complete bullshit. People gaming the system.
