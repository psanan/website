What's the simplest parrot-like "AI" I could build, to play music?
That is, it should
<ul>
  <li> Be able to produce a "next note" from a given sequence (startig with "start"?). A (possibly zero) delay, and pitch from a given set (maybe including "stop").
  <li> Be able to reproduce things it's already heard, prioritizing recency. Generalization not really important, so overfitting is probably ok.
</ul>
</p>

The overfitting is key, I think, to have it "parrot" from a small set of examples. (also reducing whatever "temperature" parameter there is)

Here's someone asking about intentionally overfitting:

(See the first duetron notebook or something similar I can hack to parrot..)
