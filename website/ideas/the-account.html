<h1>The Account</h1>
<!--END HEADER -- This line and above can be automatically rewritten!-->

<p>
A big bottleneck (or at least frustration) in my life is that very often, I simply
"just can't". I can't "do" anything. At least not anything that, in the most general sense,
is "work": anything that requires will, energy, gumption, forward thinking, effort, etc. Basically
anything harder than going to the bathroom when you need to pee.
</p>

<p>
What subtracts from the account? All the stuff you have to do in life. Most of my job,
childcare, housework, paperwork.
</p>

<p>
What adds to the account? Good sleep, time with friends, sex, progress, postive feedback,
inspiration, nature.
</p>

<p>
But here is where the analogy gets interesting. Much like real money, if your account gets too low,
you're in real trouble, because of sayings you've probably heard. "It's expensive being broke". "It takes money to make money".
For me, at the moment, it requires nontrivial energy to get those things which add to the account.
I live what I think is unfortunately a very common lifestyle for someone approaching middle age.
I am lucky to have a nice place to live, a great (if sometimes lonely and draining) job, a great partner, a wonderful kid, good health, and fulfilling
hobbies. But, unlike perhaps earlier in life, those account topper-uppers above don't seem to happen as automatically.
They require work, draining the account. For example, being in nature with friends is
very regenerative, but planning is work.
</p>

<p>
Once you're getting close to overdraft, you're in trouble. You start defaulting on things:
not having the energy to do well for work, family, etc. Not having the energy to get
off the couch to see your friends (much like not being able to afford to fix your car
to get to your job).

You may have to borrow from your life partner's account.
(Having multiple accounts working together has obvious benefits in this analogy).
You may have to take out a high interest loan by drinking too much coffee.
</p>

<p>
So what use is this analogy? Well, the big takeaway for me is to be aware of the account
and have a more
sensitive trigger for "I'm getting tired, burned out, etc." and spend from the account
in things that will refill the account by more, before you start accumulating those
overdraft fees.
</p>

<p>
Also like a real account, you might start paying attention to those little drains.
For a real account, maybe I'm buying a lot of expensive takeaway food because I didn't plan.
In the analogy, maybe I'm frittering away my attention on random crap on the internet
because I didn't set up something more edifying.
</p>

<p>
The "shared account" analogy is also powerful. Pooling resources and "buying in bulk" are quite efficient, aren't they?
