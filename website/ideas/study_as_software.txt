The Study as Software
---------------------

Reproducibility is hard. Ask any engineer in an R+D department what they think of academic papers. 

But, it needn't be this way, because the last few years have seen an explosion in easy-to-use tools and workflows for software development and testing.

Here, I champion an approach to scientific publications based on computations,
which treats a study like software, in these senses:
- regressions are likely, as the environment changes
- a new person coming to the study, or even the author after several months, would require quite a lot of effort to reproduce it, if only given the paper itself
- the most important results of the paper can be generated programmatrically

If these are true, then you can and should treat your paper as the expected output of a set of regression tests.
