"How to really learn German articles"

The hardest thing about learning German is remembering the gender of words (the articles)

I find this very true.
I live in a German-speaking country and study German, but I work in English, so I have managed to
develop some bad habits with learning and speaking German.
This is perhaps my worst one.

The standard advice is „learn articles with the words!“ Yes, you should do this.

But the way things are expressed above implies that there are two things to learn: the word and the gender. No.

There is one thing to learn: the word, which inlcludes its gender. If you don‘t know the gender, you don‘t know the word.

You may have been bitten by a similar, but somehow easier to adjust to, problem - the umlauts matter. "schon" and "schön" are as different as "bat" and "bet" in English. Say, "I bat you didn't know I was bitten by a bet!" and maaybe you'll might be understood, but you probably don't want to sound like this.

Imagine if, in English, you only knew the first letter of each word down to three options. Naybe you qould kommunicate, put uou vouldn‘t claim zo really *know* all the vords.

The standard way to learn thus applies - how do you say „time“ in German? Wrong question. Don‘t ask it. How do you say „the time“? „Die Zeit“.

Dictionaries can lead you astray here (and I had to fix my personal vocabulary list). They will have an entry like `Zeit {f}`. If you already speak German, this is fine, because then „die Zeit“ and „das Zeit“ are as different as „horse“ and „sorse“. It also helps the dictionary be precise by avoiding ambiguity about whether „die“ is the feminine singular or the plural article, but this isn‘t worth it for the language learner - you will use „der Name“ in conversation, not „Name {m}“. Seeing "Name {m}" gives the impression that the gender is a parenthetical (it's almost literally in parentheses), but it's not - it's as important as the letters in the word.

On this note, beware Duolingo - I love it, but its main goal is to keep you from quitting,
and it will let you get by without really learning the words.

So that‘s tip one: If you don‘t know the article, you don‘t know the word.

A corrollary is "don't guess". If you knew `das Pferd` was `the _orse`, you would have to conclude that you actually don't know how to say this,and would adjust your learning appropriately.

But that‘s not very constructive. How to I learn these words with articles?

The usual answer is „flashcards“. Good idea: make sure that any vocabulary studying you do has the article with every single noun, always.

But there‘s still difficulty. My little English-speaking brain just can‘t care about the gender of words! It wants to map „time“ —> „Zeit“ so badly.

What to do?

First, relax a little that even if you had to learn all the genders by brute force, there is actually a rule in German with no exceptions (!): in a compound word, the last sub-word determines the gender. „Die Zeit“, „die Uhrzeit“, „die Mahlzeit“. So, in this sense, German doesn't have as man words as it might seem.

This even extends to a large class of suffixes. „Das Mädchen“ „das Häuschen“ „die Gelegenheit“ „die Krankheit“ etc. You can and should attach „die“ to those suffixes, like they‘re words.

There are lots of other tricks out there (the names of some but not all rivers and metallic elements blah blah blah), but they probably do more harm than good, by implying that a gender can be deduced from a word. No. No. That‘s almost like saying that in English, „das Pferd“ is `the _orse` and later learning that usually with words starting with `_or`, you use an `h`, not a `t` or an `f`. Easier to just learn "the horse".

So, to summarize again, gender is not something to learn with words. It‘s part of words, though it’s not always visible. The most helpful way to learn words is with the (nominative, definite) article.

The good news is that with some words, you‘ll get it. „Die Katze“ never tripped me up. Luckily it already seems feminine.

Still, you‘re having trouble. („You“ is me, if you couldn‘t tell). How to you lesrn these things? My advice is to learn by connecting words to experiences, real or imagined. There are some words that I actually first learned with their articles, before I started studying German

Das Boot
[BILD]

Das Auto
[BILD]

Der Spiegel
[BILD]

Those are very easy to remember. The goal is to learn things this way.

Words are all around:

Die Zeit
[BILD]
Die Welt
[BILD]
Der Vorname
[BILD]


Note that the definite article is handy but not essential. I think of the people in the cafeteria saying „schönes Wochenende!“ or the sign saying „Frisches Wasser“, and it‘s as good as knowing „das Ende“ or „das Wasser“.

On the train, you will hear "eine angenehme Reise", so "die Reise".

Another one you might have know before starting to stuy is `die Musik`, from
"eine kleine Nachtmusik"
[VIDEO]

You should also include things specific to your experience. I like this song a lot,
anda I use it to remember `der Tag`, since the the title of the song is `ein Guter Tag`, and
as a bonus is helps with `das Ende`, with the line `heute das Ende bloss` (Swiss band, so Swiss spelling of `bloß` :D).
[VIDEO]

Even more useful are interesting things that happened to you. I will remember `das Velo` (`the (road) bicycle` in Switzerland)
forever because shortly after I got a new bike, a (drunk?) man on the street said "schönes Velo!" to me.

Things that you've experienced, attached to your own memories of people, places, and things, are the best flashcards,
so treasure them!

Finally, you can force it. Just look for any mnemonic. The amazing thing about them is that
they work, even when the mnemonic is nonsensical. I will never forget "Kingdom, phylum, order, family, genus, species"
because my friend Kelly came up with "kick purple cat off fence, get sued",  years ago in school.
Similarly, I remember "der Vogel" because of the male main character in this movie:

It's a stretch, but it works.



## Summary

If you are struggling with gender,

0. Realize that you don't know the word if you don't know the article
1. Make sure that all studying is done with articles attached
2. For troublesome words, find examples from your own experience ("experiential flashcards")

Do not think of gender as something to learn "with" words. It is part of words and if you don't know the gender, you don't know the word, just like if you didn't know one of the letters.
Avoid the tricks which reinforce this idea (note that learning the gender associated with suffixes is great, just think of the suffixes as words in an of themselves).
