The internet can feel like a big pile of shit sometimes

iTunes was something I loved

But it was too easy

Apple gotta make money

But there is as EFF says the public interest internet
Blogs
RSS
People building for the love of it

Case in point Decoupled


But it doesn’t do the thing I want! Playlists

But here’s the thing
It doesn’t prevent you from doing what you want

I can send files however I want

So I can write a script to make my playlists into albums. 

I had to figure out the Python ftplib and this is stilll light years less annoying than iTunes . Seriously I could not reliably do things like import files or update my phone, because of all the telemetry and bloat   

So music fans, kill your Spotify, buy things on band camp, and learn to love digital music again
