<h1>Right to Recordings</h1>
<!--END HEADER -- This line and above can be automatically rewritten!-->

<p>
Here, I make the case that people have a right to own recordings of music, be able to listen to these recordings on the devices available to most, and that the right to truly own recordings necessarily means the right to copy them. (It does not, however, mean the unlimited right to distribute copies of recordings)
</p>

<p>
What's a right? It's something we argue that is important to humans, enough that we should guarantee it to all of them. Societies, governments, and customs ensure that these rights are protected. Practically speaking, this means that these things are considered too important to be trusted entirely to unregulated capitalist systems.
</p>

<p>
Why should recordings of music fall into this? Because to many people, including me, recordings of music are part of their soul. They help process emotions, understand the world, connect with other people, and access our memories. Put another way - music is a kind of home. It gives comfort and connection. Put another way, music is a type of communication - it let's people communicate and feel things they can't otherwise. It's essential.
</p>

<p>
Michale Stipe, of R.E.M., when they play "Losing my Religion", says that the songs belongs to the audience, not to him or the band, anymore. I think that for many people, being able to listen to that song is anything but trivial.
