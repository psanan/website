It would be great to submit a crossword the NYT.

I like something where the key clues are puns
that include an English word that is also a German word meaning something different

"Gut feeling"
"Gift horse"
"Toll booth"
"Bad egg"

Kind
Fall
Duster
...

Database of all former clues? (build your own fill, use figuring out the algorithm as
a programming interview question)
