<p>Some further observations from my attempts to become a better typist.</p>
<h2>The Workman Layout</h2>
<p>I love it; no regrets. However, if you are already good at QWERTY and
  your hands aren't suffering, I wouldn't recommend switching unless
  you think it would be fun or interesting. I switched because I didn't
  want to carry over my bad QWERTY habits as I learned to touch type
  properly, and because it seemed like a cool optimization, but
  QWERTY's strength as the universal default (until we start talking
  about QWERTZ and that pesky Swiss keyboard with its elusive "@") is
  probably reason enough to use it.</p>
<ul>
<li>The layout of the keys is wonderful. Many common words just fly.</li>
<li>On a day to day basis, the layout is great. It was easy to install
    on OS X and is even easier on Ubuntu (built in). With both you can
    use the menu bar to switch back and forth for other people to type.</li>
<li>The preservation of the important shortcuts is very useful in the
    short term. The position of the command key is relatively constant
    between my different keyboards, so shortcuts can be done without
    looking down (and stay on the left side, useful in combination with
    the mouse).</li>
<li>Like any deviation from a ubiquitous standard, there are still pain
    points.<ul>
<li>My custom vim command mapping works brilliantly (I like it even
    more than the original layout) but is a problem when someone
    else wants to use my machine (one could probably define a vim
    macro to swap between the standard commands and my new ones). I
    have my vimrc in a git repository on bitbucket, so it's usually
    very quick to transfer it to a new unix-based system.</li>
<li>You cannot use the layout when using very barebones environments
    or miscellaneous machines. This was especially aggravating when
    (already frustrated) I have been forced on a couple of occasions
    to log into my Ubuntu machine in some sort of "safe mode"
    which can't remap the keys. Until I can buy a keyboard with
    workman built in (you can do this for Dvorak) I am out of luck
    in that case. There will always also be situations in which I
    don't have control over the layout (typing things into
    collaborator's machines, using Windows machines attached to
    scanners and printers, etc.)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Learning to Type</h2>
<ul>
<li>I have switched to other training tools from
    <a href="www.keybr.com">keybr.com</a>. That site is highly recommended for
    learning a new layout from scratch but once you have the lowercase
    letters down, it's probably time to move on. For learning capital
    letters and symbols, I got a lot of use out of
    <a href="www.typingclub.com">TypingClub</a>. Once you have all the keys down,
    it's time to move to the venerable <a href="www.typeracer.com">TypeRacer</a>
    or something similar. This is the way to practice because<ul>
<li>Unlike the tools above, it only highlights the word you are
    looking at, and the text you enter appears in a separate field.
    I think that is very important, and increasing speed involves
    learning to type entire words, without error. Watching as each
    character is entered (as is unfortunately the case with most
    incidental practice) encourages one to confirm each one and
    correct if needbe, when the goal should be to approach 100%
    accuracy.</li>
<li>It gives you natural text to type (albeit low on symbols, so
    supplement with something else to learn those well if you want
    to write a lot of code!).</li>
<li>Your score/speed suffers greatly if you make many typos.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>My biggest problem is rushing. I want to be able to type as fast as
    I think, but I cannot do so yet, so I inevitably try to go faster
    than I can accurately type (which is somewhere in the 75-85 wpm
    range, but slower when I have to write source code which involves
    more special characters). Related in my tendency to still want to
    "burst" on easy words, but speed and accuracy seem to be increased
    when I focus on consistent speed and flow. I think that <a href="http://www.typing-lessons.org/preliminaries_2.html">these
    tips</a> are a very
    well thought-out and concise set.</li>
<li>I have resigned myself to the asymmetry of the standard keyboard
    layout, and have sold my TypeMatrix. Being able to move between
    machines is worth it, and with a quality standard keyboard (from Das
    Keyboard) and proper posture I find that my hand pain has
    disappeared.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Speed Typing</h2>
<p>This is not something that I should be thinking about. However, I like
  to practice typing on typing websites, which show you your speed very
  prominently.</p>
<ul>
<li>Again, the natural idea that there is a tradeoff between speed and
    accuracy is a false one. In any real usage, making a mistake means
    having to delete that mistake, which will slow you down unless your
    error rate is very, very, very low. Also, trying for consistent
    speed and flow seems to be more effective (at this point) than
    trying to type easy words as fast as physically possible. For
    practicing, an error rate of 0 is your goal. That said, here are
    things I have noticed help me go faster:</li>
<li>Pretend you are playing a musical instrument<ul>
<li>Assume proper posture. This actually makes a difference,
    especially if you are a sloucher like me - your fingers coming
    in at a low angle can create inaccuracy.</li>
<li>Relax. Float over the keys.</li>
<li>Try to get into a "flow", easily progressing over the words in
    their natural rhythm. This is what musicians are doing with
    their crazy wobbling around, and it seems to also work with
    typing.</li>
<li>Drill slow/fast/medium. First, go as slow as you want, getting
    everything perfect. Then go very quickly to try and warm up the
    processes of linking things. Then, go actual speed.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Look ahead (exactly) one word. You can hold this word and the one
    you are typing in mind, it seems, and this will prevent a lot of
    pauses. [This is the only useful tip I got from reading about
    <a href="http://seanwrona.com/typing.php">extremely fast typist Sean Wrona</a>,
    whose main advice seems to be "start in childhood and develop your
    own intuitive style which frees you to improve your speed by not
    always using the same finger for each key."]</li>
<li>For some reason I was watching a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/patrick-sanan-80055157">video of someone playing a
    speed-typing
    game</a> . I was
    surprised by a comment that they prefer that the keys to press
    scrollÂ <em>faster</em>, so that they are forced to recognize small
    patterns without being distracted by larger structures. This seems
    to also be true for speed typing: it's better to not get bogged
    down in the sentence structure.</li>
</ul>
