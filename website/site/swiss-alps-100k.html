<h1>Swiss Alps 100k 2019</h1>
<!--END HEADER -- This line and above can be automatically rewritten!-->
<p class="publication-date">2019-08-17</p>

<p>My second official ultra, and a different experience from <a href="swiss-canyon-trail-105k-2019.html">the
first</a>.</p>

<p>This was the <a href="https://swissalp.ps">Swiss Alps 100k</a> - the route is just
over 100km, with about 5400m of elevation gain, starting in the Valais
at ~1300m and reaching a high point of ~2700m.</p>
<p>I underestimated this race, in several ways, and it taught me some
things. Thus, this post will include a short recap and move on to
(potential) lessons learned.</p>

<h1>Race Recap</h1>
<p>The race began at 7 am on Saturday morning. Mike and I had arrived the
evening before and registered, camping with Angie and Ryan at a nearby
campsite. Cleverly, we moved our tents once we saw the telltale signs of
partying Swiss bros nearby.</p>

<p>Mike and I trotted along in the middle of the pack for the first
"flat" 20km, which still featured a couple of steep ups and downs, and
an exciting crossing of a long bridge</p>

<p>Some more traversing next to a man-made stream to transport water across
the hill, and we were at the foot of "The Beast". This was an
evenly-graded, switchbacking fire road that climbed 1200m.</p>
<div class="grid-item">

<p>After an aid station at the top, the Breithorn, some ups and more down
led to the Rosswald aid station, shortly before the start of the very
steep climb to the Fülhorn (beware the false summit of the Fullohorn,
replete with decoy summit cross!).</p>
<p>This was the high point of the route, with great views in the perfect
weather.</p>

<p>The route had been marked well so far, with flags and spray-painted
arrows. This part of the trail was the only part that one was supposed
to covered twice - after rejoining the route, one was to turn left and
head back to the top of The Beast. However, this turn was not marked
well, and the cartoon of the route on our race bibs implied downhill all
the way back to the Breithorn. Thus, I and 4 other people happily
descended the whole way back to the Rosswald aid station, thinking that
we hadn't yet rejoined the main trail. We then had to backtrack about
2.5 km and 300m of climbing. Lame.</p>
<p>After a short climb from the Breithorn aid station, there was a long,
steep descent to Binn.</p>

minutes there changing my socks and underwear from my drop bag, eating,
and using the bathroom.</p>

<p>I was very tired already as I headed up the next climb. I was dismayed
to find that, not for the first time that day, I had filled my water
bladder with bubble-gum flavored isotonic liquid, not water. This
didn't seem to be as thirst-quenching and seemed to upset my stomache.
Luckily, I came across a fountain on the climb.</p>

<p>I was very happy to reach the top of this climb because, though
exhausted, I now knew that only one big uphill section remained.</p>

<p>I was crawling on the short, steep uphill up to the Chäserstatt aid
station. I sat for a long time, trying to eat and drink (not much good
food there - I ate cookies). The volunteers were very helpful, and let
me use a space blanket to warm up when I started shivering. Thankfully,
they also let me know ahead of time about the rolling terrain I'd
encounter on the next climb.</p>
<p>It was now totally dark. I hiked up the steep fire road that was the
start of the next climb. I turned on my headphones at this point. The
music, as usual, strongly affected me. Frida Hyvönen's "Dirty
Dancing", in particular. It was beautiful to see the lights of the
Valais, and later the almost-full moon.</p>
<p>Rolling terrain with an intermittent trail was slow going. We followed
reflectors on flags and red-and-white trail markers. Once, there were
dozens of reflectors, but all but one were cows' eyes. Near the end of
the climb, I joined up with another runner struggling to stay on route,
and we mostly stayed together to the top of the climb and down the
tricky part on the other side.</p>
<p>The last descent was tricky to stay on trail. Luckily for me, my
temporary partner had a working map on his phone, which saved us some
time during one particularly non-obvious section which involved
traversing about 100m of snow. Then, down down down to the Reckingen aid
station. This had been moved from an earlier point, shortly before the
race, so this section was a long 16km, including 900m of climbing. I had
eaten my last gel on the climb and moved quite slowly down what by
rights should have been a fast gradual downhill section down a good
trail.</p>
<p>After the aid station, some horrible rolling, traversing trails, then a
return along a gravel road the airport. Angie and Clara were there to
meet me at 2:40 am, after having stood around for a very long time, due
my very optimistic low-end estimate of the time I'd need.</p>
<p>With the wrong turn and backtracking, I took 19:39:59 and covered about
108 km with 5800m of climbing; the most elevation I've ever gained in a
day.</p>
<p>A couple of hours later, Mike rolled in to complete his first ultra,
which wasn't an easy one, even for a 100k! Huge respect.</p>

<h1>Lessons Learned</h1>
<h2>1a. Do your homework to know the route</h2>
<p>On the <a href="swiss-canyon-trail-105k-2019.html">Swiss Canyon
Trail</a>, and even more so
on the Jungrau Marathon, the route was very clearly marked (almost)
everywhere, and there was essentially no route-finding required. Those
are the only two long, organized races I've done, and they instilled a
false sense of security. Here, while the route was well marked most of
the time, I lost time and motivation in a few places due to my ignorance
of the route.</p>
<p>A side note is to not trust the "cartoon" version of the elevation
profile. For this race, the cartoon was printed on our race bibs, upside
down - handy but misleading!</p>

</div> <!--grid-item-->

<p>While this does let you know where the aid stations are, there were two
times when I felt particularly betrayed. There is the strong implication
that one purely descends from the Fülhorn (the high point) back to the
Breithorn. This isn't really true - once you rejoin the trail you came
in on, you actually ascend a little bit.</p>
<p>The last part of the race was also quite frustrating, as the cartoon
shows a steady descent after a small climb, when in fact one undulates
above and below a contour on a hiking path, with a couple of very steep
drops back to the road for the last part of the route.</p>
<p>Of course there's really no excuse, given the myriad options to study
and carry a precise map. One can even download the course and take a
look in 3D!</p>
<h2>1b. The details of the elevation profile matter</h2>
<p>It seems intuitive to me that one should first worry about the
low-frequency details of such a long course - where are the big ups and
downs? This was all I worried about, beforehand, which was a mistake.
There are is more to a course than just the average angle over a
kilometer. When you have 1000m climbs, it's easy to overlook climbs of
100-200m as insignificant, though they certainly aren't, at least
mentally, as one tries to avoid falsely anticipating "easy" sections.
The rolling section near the end of this race was difficult when tired,
as one had to constantly "change gears".</p>
<h2>2a. Other runners: trust, but confirm</h2>
<p>I wasn't very worried about being off course, when I got off course,
because in addition to my trusty cartoon, I was following other runners
making the same mistake. On the other hand, having other runners around
was very helpful, particularly at night, both for route-finding and for
moral support.</p>
<h2>2b. Make friends</h2>
<p>I stayed pretty focused on my own race, but I noticed many around me
socializing during the run, and I think it helped them have more fun and
maybe even go faster, particularly in those times when we were getting
lost or when morale otherwise flagged.</p>
<h2>3a. Weight matters</h2>
<p>My early exploits in the mountains were gung-ho
backpacking/mountaineering trips where it was a point of pride to take a
lot of junk with you. For instance, here's me hauling an 80-pound pack,
including a snowboard I could barely ride, up Mt. Baldy.</p>
<div class="grid-item">
<figure>
<a href="images/swiss-alps-100k/baldy.jpg">

<figcaption>Why not?</figcaption>
</figure>
</div> <!--grid-item-->

<p>I always felt like people counting grams were engaging in premature
optimization (the root of all evil, of course). I still believe that for
training or any endeavor away from the the edge of one's ability.
However, if you're trying to finish a race as fast as you can, you're
by definition at the edge of your ability. Thus, I'll make more of an
effort to go light next time.</p>
<p>For this race, I wasn't really sure what to bring to fulfill the
requirements that one carry some sort of long pants/leggings and a warm
upper layer. I brought some light hiking pants and light down jacket.
Those probably added a kg or two, which seems like nothing, but I
certainly noticed that my pack was heavier than normal, and carrying
extra weight up 5000m doesn't seem advisable.</p>
<h2>3b. Drop bags seem useful, but could be a time sink</h2>
<p>This was the first time I used a drop bag. It was luxurious to have
fresh underwear and socks. (A fresh shirt would have been nice, too).
However, I managed to spend 30 minutes at the aid station with the drop
bag, which is far too much, even though I felt I needed a longer break
than usual. Next time I'd bring extra socks (and even shoes) as
insurance against wet feet or blisters, but hope not to use them.</p>
<p>I realize that I could have used the drop bags to address the weight
problem above, putting heavier, warmer things into the drop bags and
only running with the lightest "legal" versions of the required gear.</p>
<p>I could also have used the drop bags to provide additional nutrition
options. It's great to have at least something you find
somewhat-appealing to eat, and several times during this run I found
that nothing fit that bill except for gels, shot blocks, coke, and
perhaps m&amp;m's. It would be smart to leave extra gels and shot blocks in
my drop bag(s), as these weren't consistently available at the aid
stations. (At the last station I did get a couple of chocolate Hammer
Gels, though - fantastic).</p>
<p>Similarly, on runs which didn't require one to carry extra batteries or
an extra headlamp, these would be useful to have in a drop bag.</p>
<p>Thus, a working approach, going forward, is that the drop bag should be
there to provide options to help you go lighter and recover from
setbacks, not as an oasis of time-wasting comfort. That thinking perhaps
extends to the aid stations themselves. On one occasion on this run, at
Chäserstatt, I didn't feel like I had any choice but to stop at the aid
station and refuel while sitting, but otherwise I think it's best to
get what you need and get moving.</p>
<h2>4. Psyche returns</h2>
<p>Unlike previous routes, I didn't immediately feel good about this one.
I was happy to finish (under the cutoff time to enter the lottery for
the Western States 100), but felt I could have done it faster (which
obviously I could have, if I'd stayed on route) and had found the last
~10 km of the course very frustrating, when usually I'd just be
excited to be on the home stretch. The post-mortem email from the race
organizers, surprisingly, mentioned that so many people had also hated
the rolling section near the end that they are actually considering
modifying the course! Despite all this, though, a couple of weeks later
I am only happy about it and am already dreaming of the next objective.</p>
