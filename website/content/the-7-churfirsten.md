[The Churfirsten!](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Churfirsten)

A jagged row of peaks, chopped out a huge tilted block, with a steep
drop of over a mile down to the Walensee. How could you not want to
traverse them?

The traditional traverse seems to choose, somewhat arbitrarily, 7 peaks,
with names approximately:

-   Chäserrugg
-   Hinterrugg
-   Schibenstol
-   Zuestoll
-   Brisi
-   Frümsel
-   Selun

They are everywhere you look:

| Last summer, I made the attempt from the first train to Walenstadt and
  succeeded in finishing 5 before heat and exhaustion got the best of
  me.
| This summer, finishing all 7 was a big goal. I recruited the
  unstoppable Annelen, and soon the big day arrived, with good weather!

We camped at the Walensee and started at 4:30. After a bit of getting
lost in the town, were soon powering up the 1700m climb to the
Chäserrugg.

It was soon getting light, and we were treated to a gorgeous view at the
summit.

Hinterrugg is really the same peak, so 2 down!

We enjoyed our first descent, down a steep rut of a trail.

Next up was Schibenstoll, with its classic view.

Thankfully we encountered a dripping faucet just below the
Schibenstoll/Zuestoll junction (as I had last time), or I would have
been done for.

Then, my third time hiking Zuestoll. This time, though, we hiked up the
other side, which was actually easier and featured a cool section hiking
underneath an overhang.

At this point I was not doing very well - quite tired and dehydrated,
and thus unable to eat enough. I was suffering at the top of Brisi.

Fortunately, we were saved by a cow barn! Thanks for sharing your water,
cows.

Even more steep grassy trails let us to Frümsel.

There are several enormous holes in the ground around here - one even
had anchors for some brave soul to rappel into. Be careful!

The technical crux was this "third class grass", marked by yellow dots
offering a shortcut to Selun.

Finally we reached the summit of Selun! The view, now the 13th time, was
about the same.

We descended on the proper trail, even running parts and arriving
exhausted (for me, anyway) in the hot valley. Annelen sprinted for the
bus and got yelled at holding it up for me.

I highly recommend any or all of these peaks! Having now collected 13
summits from amongst these 7, I'll probably take a break for a while.
