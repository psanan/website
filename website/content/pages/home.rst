About Me
--------
I am a software engineer.

Previously, I was a computational mathematician and scientific software developer.
I worked with the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics group in the Institute of Geophysics at ETH Zurich. I'm  interested in applied mathematics, computational geometry, scientific software, parallel algorithms, and physical simulation. These interests fit well with cross-disciplinary work, and I have touched on many fields of application and collaboration. These include electroacoustic and computer music, geometry processing and graphics, scientific and high-performance computing, and computational Earth science. Recent research interests include computational methods and software for large parallel geodynamic simulations modelling the long-term evolution of the Earth and other rocky planets, pipelined Krylov solvers, scientific application testing, and narrow-stencil discretization on adaptive meshes for the Stokes equations.
