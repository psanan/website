<h1>ZÃ¼ri Oberland-HÃ¶henweg</h1>

                <p>I was poking around the <a href="https://fastestknowntime.com/">Fastest Known Time
website</a> and noticed that there were a
few routes nearby, including for the <a href="https://fastestknowntime.com/route/zuri-oberland-hohenweg-switzerland">ZÃ¼ri
Oberland-HÃ¶henweg</a>,
a <a href="https://www.schweizmobil.ch/de/wanderland/routen/regionale-routen/route-069.html">regional
route</a>.
This looked like a reasonable objective during the pandemic, as it only
involved a couple of short S-Bahn rides. I planned to do the route
unsupported, carrying all my food, supplies, and garbage, with the
exception of drinking from (plentiful, yay Switzerland!) public
fountains. The route can be done as a 4-day hike, and some of the huts,
restaurants, and hotels along the way actually did appear to be open,
though I only directly observed one group of customers. I was
optimistically hoping to finish under 9 hours, though 10 was my
realistic estimate.</p>

<p>The forecast looked great: cool in the morning and about 20 in the
afternoon, with no chance of rain. I took the first train to Winterthur,
arriving just after 6, took my starting photos and started my watch, and
began following the "69" signs describing the route.</p>

<p>The route was well-marked almost the whole way, though I did make a
couple of errors and have to make short backtracks.</p>
<p>The trail made its way out of town in the cool morning and began
following a fire road. I soon came to a barricade across the road
announcing that the <a href="https://stadt.winterthur.ch/themen/leben-in-winterthur/freizeit-und-sport/ausflugsziele-freiraeume/wildpark-bruderhaus">Wildpark
Bruderhaus</a>
was closed, so I took a detour around the park, down a hill and back up,
to rejoin the trail.</p>
<p>Conditions stayed cool as I was treated to gorgeous light filtering
through clouds.</p>

<figcaption><em>Cool temperatures and beautiful light in the
morning.</em></figcaption>

<p>The trail for the first part was varied - many roads and fire roads, but
also some car-washing single track sections across grass, and some step
and root-laden forest trails. I saw very few other people for the first
half of the route.</p>
<p>The second half gains higher elevations and begins to follow steep
ridgelines more closely.</p>
<p>I saw a few hikers in very small groups, but nowhere near the number one
would normally expect on such a beautiful day, in such a beautiful
location. Temperatures stayed cool and conditions partly cloudy as I
slowly ascended, with many ups and downs.</p>

<figcaption><em>I haven't yet been able to Google the etymology of this.
If I had to guess I'd think it's from a local dialect and has nothing to
do with German or English "Hand", especially because there is a mountain
called "HÃ¶chhand" nearby, but I have no real idea!</em></figcaption>

trails</em></figcaption>

<p>I took another small detour, up and over a bump on the ridge, instead of
around it, as the trail was completely covered with felled trees.</p>
<p>Almost all of the elevation I'd slowly gained so far was lost in a
single steep downhill section, which deposited me close to lake level,
but still quite a long way from Rapperswil. While not unbearable, the
temperature increased for the last segment, which took me quite a long
time. The trail heads straight through the town and ends with a
contrived loop past the castle, along the dock, and back across the
street to the train station. I stopped my watch, having cleared the 10
hour mark by 59 seconds!</p>
