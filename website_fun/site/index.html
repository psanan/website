Welcome to my <a href="github">simple</a> website.
</p>

<p>
What might you find in this little hovel next to the information superhighway?
</p>

<p>
You can find <a href="Sanan_CV.pdf">my CV</a> and links to me on <a href="">LinkedIn</a>.
</p>

<p>
You can find <a href="https://patricksanan.org/feed">Feed</a>, where new pages/posts should appear.
</p>

<p>
You can read several descriptions of long distance mountain runs.
</p>

<p>
You can read other blog posts.
</p>

<p>
You can find some music I've made, or this lovingly-crafted playlist, or this video of an audiovisual installation with <a href="">Sam Salem</a>.
</p>

<p>
You can find a link to me on <a href="">Google Scholar</a>. I'm particularly proud of <a href="">This paper</a> and of course that I got the chance to contribute to PETSc.
</p>

You can also find this page of teaching resources.
</p>

<p>
Or, you could go somewhere else.
