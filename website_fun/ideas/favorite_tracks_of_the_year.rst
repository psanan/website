Favorite Tracks from 2021
=========================

Every year, some friends and I compile lists of our favorite tracks we've shared with one another. Here, I will consolidate the results of those lists to create a "best of 2021" list.

In addition to obviously reflecting my personal taste, this may be different in a couple of ways from the typical year-end list:

1. Many of these tracks were not released in 2021! Rather, they are tracks that I first grew to love in 2021 (Rob: Autobiographical. Dick: No fucking way!). I'm not a music journalist, nor someone with encyclopedic knowledge who has already heard every song from pervious years. I'm interested in finding good music, new to me. Recently-released music is a fertile source, so there are many 2021 tracks on this list. I also feel like the recent past, approximately 3-20 years ago, after things are brand new but before history-repeating and nostalgia kick in, is under-appreciated, so it interests me to include it here.
2. I intentionally know nothing about some of these artists or pieces. Just as the standard list only covers the previous year, it also takes as granted that the way to write about music is to give extramusical details. That is a very good way to get into music, and in some cases is the context adds to the quality of the music. However, I equally enjoying hearing music "blind," having no idea who made it, how long the track will last, what the album art is, etc. So, for tracks that struck me this way, I think it's interesting to try to describe the piece in more intrinsic terms.  That said, I will still link to artist webpages or Bandcamp pages when possible, even if I didn't know the first thing about them beforehand.

A CD emoji indicates that I also think the containing album is worthwhile (though the lack of a CD doesn't imply the opposite - in some cases I haven't spent enough with the full album to make up my mind).


TODO: after all the 2021 lists are in, assemble my final 2021 list (of 10 ordered plus 10 menshez, probably), which will be mostly from my personal top-10s but can also be influenced by the others' lists. Include links to artist-controlled sources (bandcamp or band websites)

The Top 10
----------

**Low - Disappearing**
From *HEY WHAT (2021)* üíø.

This track had to be #1, because to me it is, in a word, transcendent. The "drop" has direct effect on me. My skin crawls in the best way, I feel like I'm sailing off into a bright white future at the edge of the world, an image I think I picked up from that Chronicles of Narnia book as a child. It's joy accessible at the press of a button.

Except for a loose aversion to having too-similar tracks on this list, "`More <https://lowtheband.bandcamp.com/track/more>`__" would also be here, and is the track I first play for people from the album.

**Dry Cleaning - Scratchcard Lanyard**

Many tracks are great in some way. This is great in so many ways that get all confused trying to write about it.

It's all things at once. I feel like I understand exactly what it's saying, yet it's not exactly literal.
The music rocks hard, yet it's back-groundy.
It's anthemic, yet it the lyrics are spoken, bored.
It's completely sincere, yet dripping with sarcasm.
It's cuddly, yet it's threatening.
It's old-sounding, yet new-sounding.
