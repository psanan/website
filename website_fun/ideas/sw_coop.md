Can you work in a coop software company?

A place where the point really is to build good products (the phrase that all those disgruntled Google people used), and that's it?

Could such a place scale without the gasoline that is investors who demand endless growth?

Yes.

Some private companies, even huge ones, that seem to basically be moral.

<ul>
<li> LEGO </li>
<li> iFixit </li>
</ul>

There are nonprofits, even huge ones like  Wikimedia, that more or less seem to deliver good software
(or at least good data, which is kinda the same thing nowadays).

There are parts of huge companies like Google that seem to (still) act out
curiosity and innovation, not just profit.

There is a thing called a B Corp, but superficially seems like a gimmick.

Are there coops?
