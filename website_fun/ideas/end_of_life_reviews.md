1. End of life reviews. Gear. I need it but I wish I didn't. It'd be great if I didn't need a computer or guitar strings, or running shoes. What's the best way to choose gear? An unbiased person (prefervaly an expert) uses the gear for a long time and tells you it's pretty good. Wirecutter is one of the only mass media versions of this I know. So here I will try to do what has helped me - tell you about what I used. I'll do this at the end of its because that's something really missing from most mass reviews, since they focus on new things. This will also be an excuse to reminisce and appreciate the stuff in my life. These will be short posts, and the format will hopefully emerge as I do a few.

# End of Life Reviews, Part 1

I don't like buying stuff. I find it stressful to have to find the right thing,
when the people selling to you don't share your interests. They just want to sell
as much stuff as possible, and they'll certainly help you make a lot of the process easy,
but they don't really care if the thing is good, and they really don't care how long it
lasts in most cases - in fact, as long as their customers are happy, they'd sort of prefer
it didn't last a long time.

The best way to but stuff is to find someone you trust who can tell
you they've used something for a while and are happy with it.
Then you can just get that thing.

So, here's my attempt to create the thing I wish there was more of: end of life reviews.
To intentionally think about what happens when stuff becomes junk. When I stop using something
because it breaks or because I get a new one.

I'll rate these
A) I would have paid more for this, I will buy it again, I recomend it
B) Worth the money, happy with it
C) Mixed
D) Not a good decision in retrospect, not happy with it
F) Mad that I spent my money on this, actively discourage others to repeat my mistake

I'm not going to attempt to categorize these for now, and I may slip in a middle-of-life thing if it's lasted more than a few years.
