#FutureTrees

The idea is simple. Plant one or more trees. If you live in an apartment, put a plant in a pot.  Label it "FutureTree".

Why?
1. Plants help fight climate change by converting CO2 to oxygen
2. The plant reminds you of your commitment to fight climate change
3. Plants are nice to have around!
4. The plant is an non-confrontational way to display your commitments


Actually slowing or reversing climate change requires global, coordinated action on many fronts at once. The only way to achieve this is widespread, passionate political support. Yet the problem seems intractable to many, so it isn't discussed. This is a simple way to directly help, and just as importantly to constantly remind yourself and those around you that you care. 

What do we do?
   - Run this website 
- Sell merch, and donate the money to reforestation projects (and in the future, other efforts to fight climate change: see the donations we've made [here])
- Coordinate events independently and in coordination with other organizations

## FAQ

Q: Isn't this all symbolic? 
A: No and Yes. Plants really do sequester carbon, and lots of us planting lots of them will make a measurable difference. However, it's completely true that this alone will not be enough. That's why this project is about a symbolic gesture as well - this symbolism is part of gathering the political will to make the other required changes. Think about it like voting, in the U.S. It's easy to feel like your vote doesn't matter, but think about the way voting makes you feel good, and empowered. And then think about those little "I voted" stickers. Everyone around you sees those. These trees are like those stickers
