I was reading this paper on a model to predict phase of sounds:

This mentions instantaneous frequncy (IF) in terms of how the phase
angle for a given STFT bin evolves.

This leads to a well-cited survey on the topic:

This was a fascinating read, and leads to something that, over and over again,
has resovled intellectual roadblocks for me.

That is: when you start getting confused about what something *is*,
unask the question and instead as what something *does*.

In this case, the idea of IF for multi-component signals gets muddy
(reminds me of trying to read about strain measures while working on my thesis)
because its not well-defined.

I think that essentially, the idea is that if I give you one function,
and ask you to express it as a combination of multiple functions, there
are many ways to do it. E.g. if I give you an audio signal, there are a lot of ways to
write it down as a sum of sinusoidal components with time-varying
amplitudes and phases.

The resolution is to ask what you're trying to do with this signal.

I'm interested in one, in particular, which is how an audio signal
would be perceived by a human, via a transducer, air, and an ear.

In this arena, one really wants to know what the instantaenous frequency is,
or something like a spectrum at any point in time.

It's a mathematical fact, which I think is essentially the Uncertainty Principle,
that a time-frequency decomposition only has a finite amount of certainty
to spread between temporal and spectral resolution. THis is intuitive,
as if you want to measure frequency, you need a time window to do it over (unless
you have a very simple scenariou like an assumed mono-component signal, as in the intro of TODO).

You might be interested in all of this for a couple of related reasons:
<ul>
  <li> You want to compress a signal by throwing away most of the time frequency data
    <li> You want to understand the signal in a perceptually-relevant way, so you can make new signals
</ul>

These all seem to lead to the idea that what we really mean by instantaneous frequency
is how a signal is exciting a bank of other things!

You could think of those as the cells in your ear and the attached nerves.
You could also think of those as projections onto various basis functions in decomposing a signal.
