On procrastination

It‘s a huge problem, for some people.
Most of us experience it in school, but there it is contained.
Some of us are lucky enough to work in academia, or research, or for ourselves, or as artists. But the more self-determined you are, the more insidious it becomes.

If you haven‘t seen this video, it‘s a great descriptor:

But it doesn‘t tell you what to do about it.

He offers a follow up post, which does a good job of describing what it‘s like to tech a flow state ( the opposite of procrastination?) but I somehow think that all procrastinators are familiar with this advice and past a certain age, are trying to do these things.

So let me tell you what did it for me.

I had a report due. I was not happy about this report as I didn’t. Feel like the work had gone well. That made it unappealing to work on the report. I‘d have to face that I hadn’t done what I’d hoped Witze the project, largely due to procrastination. But it light of this, i needed to make the report as good as it could be.

The deadline was extended and I was so relieved I.d have the weekend to work. No other obligations at all. 

On Saturday, I ended up spending several hours seeing what all the top posts were on reddit in the last year. I avoid Reddit like the plague, usually, because I’ve lost time to it before. Outside the sun raced across a beautiful day.

I despaired . I finally, really asked myself „why I am doing this?“

Boredom? Not really. This was a difficult task, maybe not fun but by no means boring.

Laziness? Not really. The lazy thing would be to write a bad report. All told, I realized that procrastination was costing me time and energy. 

Lack of inspiration? I chose this project. I wrote the proposal and was excited about it. No one made me do it.

Mental illness? Unlikely. ADHD? Not likely. Lack of sleep? Too much caffeine? Worried about a sick relative? Money problems? Nope.

Bad person? Destined for failure? Charlatan? All potential no delivery? Warmer...

The only conclusion that made any sense was this: I was afraid. This fear would send my brain scampering to anything that would distract it.

You can stop right here if you want. My point is made
1. ask yourself why you‘re procrastinating
2. Accept that it‘s fear
3. Have a hard time connecting your fear with the thing you‘re running from

We can dig deeper, if we want. What is the fear? Where did it come from?
