The Mark Lee Bearathons
-----------------------

(Bear: "I'm Mark Lee and I approve these marathons")

I started out as a backpacker and mountaineer, and found my way into ultrarunning.

Ultrarunning races is fun, but I prefer the spirit of FKTs more.

One race that stands out, though, is the Barkley Marathons. It turns a lot of
things from traditional foot racing away.

I love almost everything about the Barkley except for the fact that I'll
almost certainly never get to run it. So, let's recreate it!

The central ingredient is, of course, Laz. His character shapes the whole thing,
so literal recreation is of course not the idea. Rather, what we'll take:

* The emphasis is not on the time. There is a cutoff, and success means finishing within that cutoff
* The course changes (to become more difficult) every year, so course record times aren't that meaningful
* The emphasis is on the story
* Success is not only about physical prowess, but mental fortitude
* The point is to have an unusual experience, alone and with people
* Self-reliance is key: no maps beforehand, no GPS, no phone.
* A very small number of entrants (less than 50. If it gets too popular, someone else can start another race!)
* The intentional creation of Lore (things like books and conches and cigarettes etc.)
* There is no emphasis on gender (other than to ensure good representation amonst the runners)
* The entry process is murky and subjective

Lots of things may change from year to year, including the date and the location.
What won't change is that it'll be about what I do it for: bonding through the creation of memorable experience.
