Swiss ancestors

Apparently they left Switzerland after the Franco-Prussian war,
as at the time France's loss flooded Switzerland with money,
which disrupted the economy and caused severe problems when the 
reparations ran out. My dad learned this at the Landesmuseum in Zurich.

They travelled on a ship named the Adele, after which one of my family
members was named.
