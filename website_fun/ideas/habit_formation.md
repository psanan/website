It's gotten to a point where one has to view fun things on the internet as
tricks.

But here, I want to talk about a freemium web/mobile app that has proved
very useful.

Habitica.

It's actually helped me form habits.

It's fun, but not that fun.


The closest point of comparison is Headspace. This is like Habitica
in that it was an app that taught me something and then let me escape.

Another good one is Strava, which I find extremeley useful, but
which flirts with advertising schemes a little too much for me to
declare them benevolent (even though in general I think their business
model is fine with me - I have to assume they make most of their money
from subscriptions, which is nice for something which has a lot of the
features of a social network yet doesn' thave the evil stench of facebook).
