The joy of deletion (or "Delete this Book")

One of my favorite quotes is this one, from an interview with the author George Saunders


    You know, I do this thing where I think, "okay," say you had a sentence that said, "In midafternoon, Bill, a 45 year old real estate agent, walked into the living room and sat down on the yellow couch," which is a perfectly correct sentence, but it's sort of.. you know, it's banal. So, what I do, just reflexively, is just start cutting, so okay, uh let's just keep it simple. "At midday," ah we don't care what time it is, "Bill came in and sat down on the yellow couch." ALright, if he's sitting, he doesn't have to sit down, cut the word down. "Bill sat on the couch". Is it essential that he comes in? No, because we don't know where.. okay. "Bill sat on the couch", uh "the yellow couch". Do I care what color it is? no. It doesn't signify if it's yellow or chartreuse. And then I'm like "why does he have to sit on the couch?" so, pretty soon you cut the whole thing. So you don't have anything but at least what you have isn't shit.


I think that even beyond "writing is rewriting," ones life is improved by an explicit attention to removing things. Look no further than the current fad of "Marie Kondo-ing" to see that I am not the only one who feels this way.


This is not a new idea, but I think it's one that people like me, which is to say people who like creating things, collecting things, need to explicitly think about.

This is very true with software and technical systems. Simplicity, standardization, and boring solutions are very valuable.

It's depressing to think that the clever, interesting things aren't the good ones. But it's better to think about it in the sense that only the very very clever ideas survive - the ones that are so clever that they actually make things simpler and better, as opposed to better at the cost of more complexity.

To me, this is a profound set of ideas, because it depends critically on realizing my own mortality. I will never go back and read all these things. I will never revisit every thing saved from my childhood. I will never bring all my project ideas to reality. I will never climb all those mountains, or write all those songs, or publish all those papers. I take strange comfort in the idea that I, too, will be deleted. I will die, and there is only a finite amount I can do or experience or revisit in my life. It might as well be a smaller set of things, of more concentrated quality.
