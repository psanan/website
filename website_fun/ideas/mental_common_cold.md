The mental common cold

A funk, a bad spell, a minor depression.

It is, to acute mental illness, what the common cold is to severe physical illness.
- its minor
- There is no simple treatment
- Its hard to distinguish from a more general lack of energy
- It interacts badly with other problems
- Youre expected to push through it

However, most people accept the reality of the common cold. Few accept the reallty of the mental equivalent. That‘s not a problem, in and of itself (and as far as I know, science can say a lot more about the common cold than it can about, say, minor depresion)

However, on the ground, we have to deal with it. Does making this analogy help? I say yes. Deal with it like you would a common cold:

1. accept it
2. Mitigate it
3. Proceed

Point 1 is the key. Remove yourself from it. Something is under the weather in part of your brain. The other part of your brain can recognize this. Harder than it sounds (for me, anyway) because I don't like to admit weakness.
But, it's something that can be practiced.

Point 2 means “now that you accept its real, dont make it worse. Some things are the same as the common cold
- sleep
Some are different
- exercise
- Socialize
