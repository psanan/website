# Migration

Move to my own plain HTML and CSS site (currently in website_fun), replace when ready

## Ideas

* UTMR DNF
* TIME post
* Swiss cantonal highpoints
* VLC as iTunes replacement
* PRiSM post (when done)
* See other blog post ideas
* Consolidate from windfarmmusic.wordpress.com. It's possible to export from the WordPress admin interface and [import into Pelican](https://docs.getpelican.com/en/4.2.0/importer.html>).
* Collect favorite earlier trip reports (see summitpost records, too)
* Post on California 14ers, to collect some old trip reports and photos.
* Change the front page to be like "here's what I do professionally, and here are some things of all kinds I've created or done, that I like".

I feel unhappy with the site, but maybe just because the formatting isn't nice.
