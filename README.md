## Ideas

* TIME post
* PRiSM post (when done)
* See other blog post ideas
* Consolidate from windfarmmusic.wordpress.com. It's possible to export from the WordPress admin interface and [import into Pelican](https://docs.getpelican.com/en/4.2.0/importer.html>).
* Collect favorite earlier trip reports (see summitpost records, too)

* If Pelican isn't working for some reason
  * Move to my own plain HTML and CSS (need a way to generate a feed)
  * Move to Hugo (see stub of hugo site here already)
