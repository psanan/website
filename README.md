## Ideas

* TIME post
* PRiSM post (when done)
* See other blog post ideas
* Consolidate from windfarmmusic.wordpress.com. It's possible to export from the WordPress admin interface and [import into Pelican](https://docs.getpelican.com/en/4.2.0/importer.html>).
* Collect favorite earlier trip reports (see summitpost records, too)
* Post on California 14ers, to collect some old trip reports and photos.
* Change the front page to be like "here's what I do professionally, and here are some things of all kinds I've created or done, that I like".

I feel unhappy with the site, but maybe just because the formatting isn't nice.
    * Formatting I like
        * https://www.klingbeil.com/spear/

* If Pelican isn't working for some reason
  * Move to my own plain HTML and CSS (stub in website_fun)
    * This kind of thing? https://www.kodingkitty.com/blog/how-to-build-a-website/
    * I think with careful use of minimal (Jinja?) templating for header/footer/sidebar/images, and correct use of flexbox, this is the way.
    * What is the absolute minimal thing? Really just a bunch of HTML pages which include different body content, with a common header and footer, and probably a helper or two for images (nice "figure", and a compact flex-box gallery).
  * Move to Hugo (see stub of hugo site here already)
