This is one repository because the website and CV are the same
in that they are how I present myself, publicly/professionally.

For that reason, other things I used to present myself publicly
could also go here (but best to avoid things which aren't on the CV
or the website!)

I go back and forth on whether it's good to do this, but it seems simple
and life seems short, now.

## Ideas

* Move to Hugo (see stub of hugo site here already)
* TIME post
* PRiSM post (when done)
* See other blog post ideas
* Consolidate from windfarmmusic.wordpress.com. It's possible to export from the WordPress admin interface and [import into Pelican](https://docs.getpelican.com/en/4.2.0/importer.html>).
* Collect favorite earlier trip reports (see summitpost records, too)
