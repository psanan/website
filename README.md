This is one repository because the website and CV are the same
in that they are how I present myself, publicly/professionally.

For that reason, other things I used to present myself publicly
could also go here (but best to avoid things which aren't on the CV
or the website!)

I go back and forth on whether it's good to do this, but it seems simple
and life seems short, now.
