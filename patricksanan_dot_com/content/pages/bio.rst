Patrick Sanan is a computational mathematician and scientific software developer.
He is currently a postdoctoral researcher in the `Geophysical Fluid Dynamics group`_ in the Institute of Geophysics at ETH Zurich. He is interested in applied mathematics, computational geometry, scientific software, parallel algorithms, and physical simulation. These interests fit well with cross-disciplinary work, and he has touched on many fields of application and collaboration. These include electroacoustic and computer music while studying at UC San Diego and the University of Manchester, geometry processing and graphics while pursuing a PhD at Caltech, and computational Earth science at USI Lugano and ETH Zurich. Current research interests include computational methods for large parallel simulations of highly-viscous flows, suitable for modelling long-term, large-scale evolution of the Earth and other rocky planets.
