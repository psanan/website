Patrick Sanan is a computational mathematician and scientific software developer.
He is currently a postdoctoral researcher in the `Geophysical Fluid Dynamics group`_ in the Institute of Geophysics at ETH Zurich. He is interested in applied mathematics, computational geometry, scientific software, parallel algorithms, and physical simulation. These interests fit well with cross-disciplinary work, and he has touched on many fields of application and collaboration. These include electroacoustic and computer music, geometry processing and graphics, scientific and high-performance computing, and computational Earth science. Current research interests include computational methods and software for large parallel geodynamic simulations modelling the long-term evolution of the Earth and other rocky planets, pipelined Krylov solvers, scientific application testing, and narrow-stencil discretization on adaptive meshes for the Stokes equations.
