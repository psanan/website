<h1>Swiss Canyon Trail 105k 2019</h1>
<!--END HEADER -- This line and above can be automatically rewritten!-->

<p class="publication-date">2019-06-10</p>

<p>My first official ultra! <a href="https://swisscanyontrail.com/ultra-trail-105k/">112 kilometers, 5500m of elevation gain</a>.</p>
<p>I was quite nervous about it, as at about 70 miles it'd be my
second-longest distance covered in a day (and only 7km less than the
<a href="https://patricksanan.org/transalp-2-lago-2-see-120k-in-a-day.html">longest</a>), and
by far the most elevation I'd attempted in a day (about 5500 meters
or 18000 feet of climbing, more than the 4500m or so for the <a href="https://patricksanan.org/the-7-churfirsten.html">7
Churfirsten last summer</a>). I was
most nervous, however, because after a 70 km training run two weeks
before, I'd had some persistent minor pain in my ankle, and was
worried that it'd worsen at some point during the race.</p>
<p>I got on the train after work on Friday and got off of at Couvet, in the
Val de Travers, in French-speaking northwest Switzerland. I was
surprised to see 0 other people heading to the race, and in fact was
beginning to worry I'd gotten the date wrong before I arrived at the
Couvet Sport Center, where the race village was. I walked in what turned
out to be the back door an almost managed to get my bib without going
through the bag check. I guess everyone else drove!</p>
<p>I was surprised at what a family affair the race was. It seemed like
most of the town, young and old, was volunteering, and I walked in
during a children's breakdancing demonstration. A second troupe of
breakdancing children was waiting to go on next. This isn't even the
first time I've seen children's breakdancing in provincial
Switzerland. This was followed by an adorable awards ceremony, I assume
for children's races during the day. I greatly enjoyed my plate of
pasta, included with my race fee.</p>

<p>I soon learned that I was apparently the only person expecting to be
able to camp at the start. I had confirmed via email that this was
possible, but no one seemed to know what I was talking about.
Fortunately, the race volunteers were extremely nice throughout the
whole event, and one offered to let me sleep in her house! I was
thrilled to get to sleep on a bed, with a bathroom and a way to charge
my phone, instead of in my tent. Merci beaucoup, Marianne!</p>

<p>Everyone milled around inside until about 4:50, when we headed to the

for about 500 runners. A couple of minutes after 5, we were off!</p>

<h2>Section 1: The Big Climbs</h2>
<p>I had mentally divided the course into 2 sections: the first part
included the 4 big climbs of the route (\~700 m, \~700m, \~1000m,
\~500m), ending at about 70km. Then came the "coda" which had less
sustained uphill, but did notably feature two \~300m climbs at the end.
I decided (and somehow managed) to not look at my watch until the end of
the first section. I think the idea was to try and delay any sort of
deal-making or anticipatory mentality as long as possible. Being at the
start of such a long, well-marked route made things quite simple. All I
had to do was continue going, as efficiently as possible, at an
indefinitely sustainable pace, consume enough calories/water/salt,
reapply sunscreen, and not roll my ankle.</p>
<p>The first part of the route, in the lovely cool of the morning, headed
out of the town and along flat roads, until climbing over a \~300m trail
section (a bit of muddy single-track, which enforced a tight single-file
crowd), and then a fast section down a paved road. The first aid station
sat at the bottom of climb 1/4, heading up to the Creux du Van (with the
touristic moniker "The Grand Canyon of Switzerland"; like most things
in Switzerland, it's comparatively tiny). This was walking up a fire
road which turned into tight, single-file switchbacks before opening up
on to a broad meadow at the top of the climb.</p>

</div> <!--grid-item-->

<p>I was disappointed to not really get much of a view of the Creux du Van,
as it was on the other side of a rock wall. The peer pressure made me
not want to stop for too long taking photos. The next section was
beautiful, cruising gently downhill. There were a few stretches, here
and later, through cow pastures, which made me cautious about rolling an
ankle. I ate some apples and bananas at the second aid station, but
avoided this from then on, after noticing the rumbling in my belly.</p>

<p>The downhill section ended with some very fun steep forest trails,
spitting us out at the bottom of climb #2. This wound up a beautiful
canyon, equipped with stairs, boardwalks, and chains.</p>

<p>The top opened out into grassy meadows again, and revealed the summit of
Chasseron, the high point of the race.</p>

<p>This peak is one of the most topographically isolated in Switzerland,
and it was a great feeling when the expansive view south exploded into
view, over the plains and the huge lake to the giant peaks of the
Bernese Oberland.</p>

<p>After stopping for a few pictures and the aid station at the top of the
peak, it was time for the biggest descent of the day - 1000m down. This
went much more quickly than I had thought it would! The descent featured
the only time when I even briefly lost the trail, but fortunately some
runners ahead of me got even more lost, and so I was able to follow them
as they located the correct path after doubling back.</p>
<p>Another aid station at the bottom of the hill promised less than 10km to
the next station, so foolishly I decided that I wouldn't need to refill
the water bladder in my backpack, thinking I'd save the weight on the
big climb, #3. The climb started off well enough but essentially all of
that 10km was climbing, including a series of false summits as one
traversed a ridge to the actual peak.</p>

<p>I was not feeling too happy at this point, as it had gotten sunny and I
was dehydrated. I was very much looking forward to the short descent to
the next aid station to try and get some fluids, but this turned out to
be the steepest and most technical part of the entire route, scrabbling
down a rubble-filled gulley, using roots and fixed ropes. I took my only
fall of the day on some loose rocks here, but soon enough was bursting
out of the bushes at the bottom and at the aid station. I drank probably
too much of all the liquids I could (water, isotonic drink, coke,
rivella, but not the disgusting blue stuff), filled my water bladder
again, tried to eat a little, and continued on.</p>
<p>Some less-severe terrain followed, with some ups and downs and another
aid station before reaching the bottom of climb #4, ascending another
scenic gorge with precarious-seeming-if-tired walkways and chains. This
turned back into meadows and seemingly-interminable hiking lead me and
some puffing compatriots along a ridge, almost the whole way back to the
summit of Chasseron.</p>

<p>I was dreading the last few tens of meters of climbing when suddenly the
next checkpoint appeared, meaning that section 1 was finished! I finally
checked my watch - 15:15, ahead of what I'd hoped. I'd told myself
beforehand that if I could make it to this point in reasonable time and
shape, I would be able to finish in some fashion, so I was thrilled.</p>


<h2>Section 2 : The Low and the High</h2>
<p>| A steep descent through fields and then the forest took me back down -
  I was very happy to find a fountain here to refill my water, as I was
  completely out again. The aid station at the bottom marked 75km and
  the start of another climb.</p>
<p>I don't remember the next section so well, but it was rolling terrain,
and quite sunny, so I wasn't too happy as I kept feeling like I was
running out of water, and hence not able to eat enough. I was passed by
a few people during this part, and I think I realized that I was not
eating enough. I finished the last of the gus and shot blocks I'd been
carrying during this section, I think. I should have brought more of
these - I only carried 4 gels and pack of energy gummies, thinking that
I'd get more than enough food at the aid stations, not anticipating
that none of the food at the aid stations would seem very appealing. I
managed to pick it up a little a bit and was very heartened to see the
marker for kilometer 90 appear. I remember thinking, "20 km is
something I can reason about," meaning that it was perhaps time to
start using the promise of the finish to motivate me.</p>

</a>
<figcaption>I kind of forget what was going on during this part.</figcaption>
</figure>
</div> <!--grid-item-->

<p>Nonetheless, I was not feeling very happy when I arrived at the aid
  station at km 95. I could feel myself slowing down, which I attributed
  to not eating enough, and was just feeling tired - learning that it
  was in fact 17 km to the end, not the &lt;15 I'd had in my head, was
  enough to dishearten me further. It was about 7pm and I was worried
  that I would slow to a crawl and not even make my 18 hour goal (11pm
  finish), which had seemed very much in reach. There were still two
  fairly sizeable climbs left - about 300m each - and one
  obviously-steep downhill section. I'm happy that I had correctly
  diagnosed the issue, though, and that I decided to take a longer break
  and this aid station and try to get more food into myself. I hadn't
  really been excited by any of the offerings at the aid stations, but
  the last two had promised pasta, which they had in the form of
  risotto - plain or avec champignons. I opted for the former,
  mechanically shoveling the dry, flavorless grains into my mouth. This
  was by far the longest I'd stopped at an aid station, and as it was
  well into the evening, I started to get cold and was visibly shivering
  as I fumbled with my phone and headphones.
A cheerful boy came up to me and asked "ça va?": I think I just
  smiled and mumbled "I'm good just cold" or something to that
  effect, taking this as a cue to get on with it.</p>
<p>I'd purposefully kept listening to music in reserve until now, as
  I'd found it so staggeringly effective in getting me through the last
  part of the 120km transalp route a couple of summers
  ago.
I dragged myself up and started on the next part, a descent of a
  couple hundred meters down a fire road.</p>
<p>You can never tell which song is going to end up being the one playing
on a loop in your head, during efforts like these. For me it's often
something I haven't heard in a long time, triggered by some chance
association. The worst was the same 4 bars of "U Can't Touch This",
endlessly repeating. This time, I was fortunate enough to have it be a
song I really like and have been listening to a lot lately, <a href="https://zammuto.bandcamp.com/track/my-dogs-eyes">"My Dog's
Eyes"</a>, by
<a href="https://www.zammutosound.com">Zammuto</a>:</p>
<p>Since I'd already spent a good portion of the last 14 hours listening
to it in my head, I started with this track, loving the meditative
beauty of so much of Nick Zammuto's work. Next, I decided that I really
needed to bring out the big guns, in terms of pump-up jams, so went to
the "Robyn" artist section and hit "zufällig" (random). In what at
the time seemed like divine providence, I was hit with the opening
strains of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoDIPobm24o">"In My
Eyes"</a>, which is
absolutely my favorite Robyn track and in terms of raw emotional impact
for me, certainly in my top 10 tracks of all time.</p>
<p>The effect was immediate and phenomenal. I had read somewhere on the
internet about how music can diminish pain in a very real way, and
this was abundantly true in this case. My legs just simply stopped
hurting. Combined with the fact that I'd finally rehydrated and
refueled at the aid station, my mood had completely reversed itself
and I was ready to finish.
The blessing from above continued as
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mru9GG3ur9U">"Honey"</a>, maybe my
second-favorite Robyn track, followed.
I felt like I was flying down the fire road, passing several people
and preparing for the rest of the course. I knew I had 2 climbs and 2
descents remaining, from the bottom of the valley.</p>

<figcaption>I stopped remembering to take pictures by this point, mostly, but this is from the bottom of the second-to-last climb.</figcaption>
</figure>
</div> <!--grid-item-->
<p>I was feeling peaceful walking up the first climb, relishing the music
from my headphones. The tracks I'd learned to love in my early 20s
really seemed to hit home: Boards of Canada, Radiohead, The Books, Aphex
Twin. Also particularly memorable was Indian Ocean's "Bhor Bhor", a
later discovery (thanks, PT!).</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ez13hMIzaGw">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ez13hMIzaGw</a></p>
<p>I yo-yo'd with a couple of other runners and reached the top feeling
pretty good. A technical downhill section followed, and then what seemed
like some cruel teases that I was ready to begin the next climb - a
scramble up some steep dirt to cross behind a rockfall-guarding fence
was particularly memorable.</p>
<p>Then, on to the final climb! This was in a couple of sections with flat
running in between. The last part made me chuckle in its sadism - a
(seemingly)-endless steep trail, with what seemed like about a 15%
grade, slowed everyone to a crawl. A race volunteer stood at the top
checking that people were okay. Another short climb, punctuated by an
angelic volunteer offering an extra cup of water (at this point I
incorrectly stowed and lost my eco-goblet), led to the final aid
station.</p>
<p>I walked up the last brief uphill section before starting the final
descent. It was almost completely dark now, and the very steep top
section looked magical, as the trail markers had been equipped with
lamps and glowsticks. I stopped on the jarring descent to put on my
headlamp. The trail became easier and easier, opening up into a gorgeous
soft trail, a fire road, and then asphalt, as I felt I was going faster
and faster. Spurred by the Crystal Method, I flew past an enormous pile
of white rock beside a glowing quarry. Faster and faster I pounded
through the last few turns, following the orange arrows spray-painted
onto the street. Soon I was rounding the last turn, across the track,
and through the inflatable arch. The last couple of kilometers felt like
I'd just headed out for a weekday jog - painless.</p>
<p>I finished just after 10 pm, for 17:05 total.</p>

<h2>Heading Home</h2>
<p>The end was strangely casual - people trickle in over such a long period
that the finish is mostly deserted. I drank some water and coke, got my
T-shirt from the friendly volunteers (the limited context, the
slower-speaking French Swiss, and the occasional English-speaker made my
almost complete ignorance of French a non-issue most of the time). Clara
thankfully pointed out that I could actually make the last train, so I
hastily collected my giant bag with unused tent, and walked back to the
train station, smelling like a garbage dump.</p>
<p>I spent the next 4 hours discovering various instances of chafing,
blisters and minor abrasions. As I staggered between train platforms, I
observed the ways of the drunken Swiss youth, and arrived home at 3 am
(thankfully possible, as there are night services to transport said
tipsy Swisslings safely back to their dorfs). Then, a glorious shower
and bed. Strangely enough, my ankle felt perfectly fine through the race
and afterwards - I wonder if my animal brain was frantically trying to
find excuses to convince me not to intentionally waste so much energy..</p>
<p>All in all, a really great day, and thanks so much to all those who
encouraged me! It was encouraging to know people were following along as
I progressed through the checkpoints.</p>
