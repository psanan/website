<h2>The Idea</h2>
<p>A simple notion, from my friend Robb: cross the Alps, on foot, in a
  day.</p>
<p>"Day" could mean within a calender day, within a 24 hour period, or
perhaps even "in a push" (without sleeping).</p>
<p>"Cross the Alps" is a little harder to define. It seems reasonable
that one would like to go from "plain level" on one side, to "plain
level" on the other side, without somehow "going around". However,
this is a little tricky, because many valleys penetrate very deep into
the range and are connected by passes. For instance, can one simply
cross the Gotthard pass, from Airolo to Göshenen? This doesn't seem
satisfying, as both are at about 1000m (plain level is about 300m to the
south and 500m to the north). But, how far down the valley must one go
in either direction for it to "count"? Our first route, last summer,
answered this question by connecting the SBB stations at either end of
the just-opened Gotthard Base Tunnel, the longest train tunnel in the
world at 57 km. This is a nice definition of "connecting the plains"
as the point of a "base" tunnel is to allow trains to proceed without
having to climb or descend any significant amount.</p>
<p>This year, we pursued another idea, a variant of our initial, 2-day
attempt two years ago. The conceit is to connect a very large
plans-level lake in the South with a very large plains-level lake in the
North. Specifically, we aimed to go from Lago Maggiore to the
Vierwaldstättersee (Lake Lucerne). This would conveniently connect the
SBB stations of Locarno and Flüelen, via a beautiful route crossing most
of the cantons of Ticino and Uri.</p>
<h2>The Route</h2>
<p>| Given my abilities and the distance between the endpoints (about 80km
  as the crow flies), it seemed obvious to take advantage of the
  Gotthard Pass. This pass, after all, has centuries of history as one
  of the easiest ways to cross the range! The minimal-elevation-change
  route between Flüelen and Locarno would be to head to Bellinzona (with
  its fortresses built to defend this route) and then follow the old
  trade route over the pass. We decided on a more direct route with more
  elevation change. This ascends the beautiful (even in the dark)
  Vallemaggia north from Locarno (~300m), crosses Passo Sassello
  (~2300m) to Airolo (~1100) and then proceeds over the Gotthard pass
  (~2000m) before taking the path of least resistance to Flüelen
  (~500m).</p>

<h2>The First Attempt</h2>
<p>Robb and I made our first attempt in late July, when he was in
  Switzerland for a visit. The weather was gorgeous - a little warm but
  clear. Unfortunately, it was not meant to be.</p>

<div class="grid-item">

</div> <!--grid-item-->

<p>Robb found himself ill and unable to metabolize food well enough to
continue, and I found myself under-prepared. I had not broken in my new
shoes, had not done enough long-distance training, and was recovering
from a calf strain; within the first 20-30km my calves felt like rocks.</p>

<p>Robb decided he needed a long break at about Peccia, and I continued up,
but found myself unable to continuously jog the totally-flat portion
along Lago Sambuca. I was, however, treated to a display of Swiss Army
people (who look exactly like their plastic counterparts), parachuting
in and landing at the bottom of the dam.</p>

<p>I then missed a trail junction and added a couple of unnecessary
kilometers. I was hot and exhausted by the time I arrived at Passo
Sassello after some muddy, steep trails. I soon found my calves buckling
whenever I tried to run, and taking another wrong turn and ending on a
seemingly-endless up and down traverse convinced me that there was no
feasible way to complete the route that day. In retrospect I suppose
that with a very long period of walking I could have completed the "in
a push" variant, but this wasn't something that even crossed my mind.
I slowly descended what seemed like an endless series of trails to
Airolo, and got on the train home. My staggering was subjected to some
good-natured mockery in Swiss German.</p>
<p>Robb took a nap, got some breakfast in Fusio, and had a nice day hiking
over a different pass, back to Airolo. Both he and I ended up doing
about 65km that day.</p>
<h2>The Second Attempt</h2>
<p>The summer seemed to be ending quickly, so I jumped at the opportunity
for a solo attempt on a single day, September 15, without rain in the
forecast. It had snowed at Passo Sassello the previous week, so I was
quite worried about that section being a muddy mess. The forecast was
mostly for temperatures around 5-10C, with a small chance of rain later
in the day.</p>
<p>I took the last train from Zurich to Locarno. It was cold and wet
outside, and I was quite anxious as I dozed, not very confident in my
ability to complete the route, worried I would get hit by bad weather,
worried that I wasn't fully recovered from the Jungfrau Marathon 6 days
before. I even went so far as to look up return routes back home, but as
I was on the last train, there were none. I figured I might as well
spend the night jogging as opposed to sleeping outside somewhere.</p>
<p>I arrived in Locarno just before 00:30 on Friday morning. I snapped a
selfie with the FART station (hilarious) and started off, taking the
short detour down to the lake before heading towards the Vallemaggia.</p>

<p>On previous attempts, we'd taken a circuitous route through parks along
the river, to avoid the direct route, a shoulderless road heading to
Ponte Brolla. This time I simply took the road. There were a couple of
hairy sections where I wouldn't have wanted to meet a car, but very
little traffic (thankfully this was Thursday night, not Friday night
when drunk drivers would be a concern). Soon enough I reached the
junction near Ponte Brolla and began the first section of the route
proper, following the road to Bignasco.</p>
<p>The moon hadn't risen and the sky was clear, so I was treated to a
beautiful Milky Way. This section went quite smoothly, as this was now
my third time running up the valley.</p>
<p>I spent most of my time on the road itself, as there was almost no
traffic once I got away from Locarno. I didn't even need my headlamp,
though it was quite dark, as the white lines on the road were enough to
stay on the perfectly flat surface. I jogged essentially the entire way
to Bignasco, about 27 km in, stopping a couple of times to look at the
map and eat a banana. The church bell rang 4 times as I arrived.</p>
<p>It was quite windy at times. The valley is very spooky at night, in how
quiet and remote it seems.</p>
<p>The next 10km started with a section on rocky trail, which made me wish
I had just taken the road. It probably saves some distance (I doubt it
saved time), but the road can be done mindlessly, and there were no cars
to be concerned with. On the plus side, on the trail I saw a pair of
European Polecats (the domesticated ferret is a subspecies of these),
who didn't seem at all concerned with me and ambled past on the trail.</p>
<p>I arrived at Peccia, about where Robb and I parted ways on the first
attempt, at 5:45. This is about 37km in, and the trail steepens greatly
as you cut a series of steep switchbacks in the road. After rejoining
the road, the grade eases up and even flattens a bit as you move to
Fusio, the last town before the pass. I arrived there at 7, having seen
my first person of the run sitting on the side of the road, waiting for
a ride it seemed. Along this stretch I decided that I would no longer
attempt to run any significantly uphill sections, as the speed increase
didn't warrant the fatigue in my legs that I would surely feel at the
end of the route. A few commuters sped past in the opposite direction,
but there were never any cars heading uphill.</p>
<p>It was cold but I forced myself to down a bottle of water as I walked
from Fusio up to the dam of Lago Sambuca, arriving there at 7:30.</p>

<p>I was very happy that, on this attempt, I had no trouble jogging the
flat length of the dam. This time I was also on the lookout for the
proper trail to join up to the pass and thankfully located it. I had
been very worried that this section of the route would be a mud bath,
but it seems that being later in the year, the ground was dry enough to
absorb the water from the rain and snow during the previous week, and
was actually significantly less muddy than the previous attempt.</p>

<p>Progress up the hill was much easier than the last attempt, and I
reveled in the perfect cool morning temperatures. The cool temperatures
were very helpful for the entire route - occasionally uncomfortable but
worth it for the reduction in sweating. I was thrilled to make it to
Passo Sassello at 9:26, and began my way down the other side, excited
for lunch in Airolo.</p>

<p>I managed to easily avoid my previous route-finding error, joining a
very steep road leading down from some alps. Along the way I surprised a
fox, who scrambled away into the brush. I picked up some trail signs to
Airolo, which did lead there but not the way I had hoped (quickly
rejoining some roads leading to Nante), and I ended up on some familiar
territory from my last descent (though, thankfully, with only a little
bit of additional climbing during a long traverse). The descent seemed
interminable as I clumped down muddy fields and roads, finally arriving
at the valley floor, taking a tunnel under the freeway,  running under
the train station, and ending up at the pizza place at 11:45. I was
feeling quite happy with the route so far, as I was over halfway
finished (65 km in) and only had the 1000m or so left to the Gotthard
pass to climb.</p>
<p>I enjoyed a Rivella and bad funghi pizza of the kind that restaurants
around here seem to be able to prepare in \&lt;5 minutes. It was fantastic.
I wanted to sit in the restaurant so after I had finished eating in
about 15 minutes, I nursed a coffee and tried not to smell too bad after
my recent descent through cow pastures.</p>

<p>At about 1pm I dragged myself back outside and began the hike to the
Gotthard pass, following the copious signs up switchbacks past the
impressive old and new roads that braid their way up. I reached the pass
at 2:45.</p>

<p>My body was beginning to protest quite a bit by this point, so I focused
as I could on efficiently moving down the hill to Göshenen, aiming to
get there by 6 pm. Focusing on using my arms helped a lot. The muddiness
was good on this section, as it softened the trail. The route from
Hospental to Andermatt is frustratingly convoluted, as one is directed
around a golf course (it might have been better to take the main road,
as opposed to following the hiking trails). I picked up some extra
batteries for my dimming headlamp at the Kiosk at the Andermatt train
station, fearing that it wouldn't be sufficient if caught in the dark
before reaching "civilization" at Amsteg.</p>
<p>I passed the amazing constructions between Andermatt and Göshenen, the
waterfalls roaring, and arrived there at 5:30 pm. I then began a
previously-untravelled section between Göshenen and Gurtnellen. Trail
signs kept me on track, with many creative trail constructions allowing
one to thread down the steep valley. I found myself in Gurtnellen on the
"correct" route that I had missed on my last transalp route. This
involves following a trail which runs along the river and then suddenly
crosses a couple of bridges, underneath the freeway, and then climbs a
long series of stairs. This section didn't have many route markers, so
I was quite worried I was climbing for nothing, but eventually I found
myself back on the trail leading to Amsteg.</p>
<p>It was now almost completely dark.</p>
<p>On the previous route, I had also covered this section, but in a
downpour at night. My legs were getting very sore by now and I focused
on using my arms to keep some sort of a jog whenever possible, still
walking any uphills. I noted the shed I'd sheltered in from the rain on
the last attempt, when I'd thought I was lost, and the bridges with
roaring streams underneath, which I'd seen illuminated before by
flashes of lightning.</p>
<p>Morale was getting low by now, as it often does when the sun goes down
again.</p>
<p>I finally arrived in Amsteg, just past the 100km point, rejoicing at my
return to "civilization". From here the route is almost entirely flat
and on roads.</p>

<p>On the previous route I had simply followed the road almost the entire
way to Erstfeld from here, and I was hoping that it'd be that easy to
continue to Flüelen. I stopped for a break on some steps, checked my
phone and texted with Clara and Dan, looked at the weather forecast
(improving, now no chance of rain), and tried to estimate the distance.
Google maps told me it was only 16km to the train station. It was now
8:30 and the last train left Flüelen at 10:42. With good route-finding
this seemed just possible to do; ten miles in 2 hours shouldn't be too
hard, right? I put away the poles, pulled out the secret weapon (a
collection of Robyn tracks on my heaphones), ate yet another gu, and set
off.</p>
<p>For the first 2-3 km, I felt absolutely euphoric. I was going to make
it! I was running at a good pace, around 6 min/km, one downhill km at a
hair above 5 minutes.</p>
<p>I followed the way I remembered from last time to the Erstfeld train
station. This is mainly on the road but at a certain point the sidewalk
ends and one must join a fire road along the river and then take some
city streets to get to the station. I moved over to the side of the fire
road at one point to let a bicycle pass me. Eventually I realized that I
was hallucinating and there was no biker. Minor visual hallucinations
continued, usually in the form of seeing a person or animal moving in
the distance, wondering if it wasn't just a hallucination, concluding
that it was real, then concluding that it wasn't real, after getting
closer.</p>
<p>After Erstfeld I was again in untravelled territory. I was running out
of energy and water, and slowed down a bit before finding a stream from
which I could drink and thus eat another gel. I trusted google maps to
give me the route to the finish. I had initially planned to simply
follow the main road and trail signs to Altdorf, but Google promised me
a tantalizing shortcut which might allow me to make the train. So far it
had done well, taking me along a broad bike path. I followed blindly,
and was dismayed when I found myself on a high speed frontage road with
no shoulder. Unlike the start of the route, it was Friday night and I
was worried about drunk drivers, given some of the driving I'd seen in
the last couple of hours. I gave up on the train and took a detour on
smaller streets and trails.</p>
<p>Things got hard at this point, as my drive to make the train had been
masking some of my fatigue (and I had pushed myself more than I would
have, otherwise). I was reduced to walking the last couple of
kilometers. At one point I passed a spooky building with a sign reading
"Kadaver-Sammelstelle".</p>

<p>I finally reach the Flüelen SBB station at about 23:15. I turned on
Strava for the last few meters, managing to jog an epic 8:15 min/km
pace. I took some pictures with my phone and texted some people.</p>

<p>I got myself a can of Rivella and some Haribo Goldbären (gummy bears)
from the vending machine and made my way to the enclosed waiting area on
the platform. I wasn't sure if someone would kick me out of there, so
after putting on all the clothes I had, I lay down on the bench out of
sight.</p>

<p>Finally relaxing felt quite incredible. I shook all over, feeling so
good to shiver. I spent the next few hours on the bench, a little cold
but glad to rest. The roar of freight trains passing through the station
all night was somehow comforting. I woke to 5 church bells, and after
very slowly making my way to the WC and back, boarded the 5:40 train
home.</p>
