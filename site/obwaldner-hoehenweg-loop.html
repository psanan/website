<h1>Obwaldner Höhenweg Loop</h1>

<p class="publication-date">2020-09-13</p>

<p>Since many races were cancelled, this summer has seen a surge in
popularity chasing <a href="www.fastestknowntime.org">Fastest Known Times
(FKTs)</a>. One decides on some hiking,
scrambling, and/or running route and attempts to do it in the fastest
known time. The routes vary to include completions of long trails (e.g.
<a href="https://fastestknowntime.com/route/pacific-crest-trail-ca-or-wa">the Pacific Crest
Trail</a>
or the <a href="https://fastestknowntime.com/route/alpina-red-trail-slovenia-italy-austria-germany-liechtenstein-switzerland-france-monaco">Via
Alpina</a>),
speed runs up mountains (e.g. <a href="https://fastestknowntime.com/route/mt-whitney-ca">Mt.
Whitney</a> or <a href="https://fastestknowntime.com/route/matterhorn-switzerland-italy">the
Matterhorn</a>
), and completing sets of summits (e.g. <a href="https://fastestknowntime.com/route/california-fourteeners-ca">The California
14ers</a> or
the <a href="https://www.gofar.org.uk/uk-big-3-records">big UK fell running
rounds</a>).</p>
<p>There are a reasonable <a href="https://fastestknowntime.com/fkt-guidelines">set of
guidelines</a>, but in most
cases the most important considerations are history and repeatability -
to claim an FKT, you have to play by the same rules as the previous
fastest person, on a route that people want to do.</p>
<p>One of the many ways this is unlike most other competitions is that
there is no second place. There's only a series of increasingly fast
times. Another, complementary, fact is that there is no limit of the
number of routes that can exist, who can attempt them, or when.
Together, these support my favorite aspect: cleverness and creativity
are rewarded (good, since I'm more creative and clever than I am fast).</p>
<p>One particular opportunity for this is to establish a new route by
setting what is known as an Only Known Time (OKT) - you do your best to
confirm that no one has ever publicly claimed any time on an interesting
route, and then record your own, as a baseline for future attempts.</p>
<p>Of the essentially-limitless number of possibilities, what qualifies as
a route worth recording times on? Clearly some threshold of "quality"
is required to keep in the spirit of things. Further, this is not purely
an academic question, as the primary database for keeping track of these
is run by a very small group of enthusiasts. The main qualification for
establishing an OKT is that it will inspire - people will be interested
in the record and some will try to break it. The story is an
inextricable aspect - someone will wonder "How fast could it be done?
How fast has it been done? What as it like? Could I do it?".</p>

<h2>The Route</h2>
<p>I submitted <a href="https://fastestknowntime.com/fkt/patrick-sanan-zuri-oberland-hohenweg-switzerland-2020-05-16">my first
FKT</a>
a few months ago, for an unsupported (carry everything, except water)
run on the <a href="https://fastestknowntime.com/route/zuri-oberland-hohenweg-switzerland">Züri Oberland
Höhenweg</a>.
I really enjoyed it, not just on the route but also in connecting with
people afterwards, and naturally thought about trying another one. I had
appreciated how being on the regional trail provided an obvious way to
define a worthwhile route: someone involved with promoting Swiss tourism
did the work to chose a relatively small number of routes which visit
beautiful areas around the country, follow good trails, and are
logistically convenient.</p>
<p>For my next objective, one route jumped out at me. Another Höhenweg
(high route)! The <a href="https://www.schweizmobil.ch/de/wanderland/routen/route-057.html">Obwaldner
Höhenweg</a>
runs for about 100km between Pilatus and the Stanserhorn, in the canton
of Obwalden, right in the middle of Switzerland. This promised a
beautiful location between Lake Lucerne and Lake Brienz.</p>
<p>Compared to the Züri Oberland route, this one is longer, higher, and
more technical, but has in common that it's well-marked and on good
trails. The route has a lot of up and down - over 6000m of ascent!</p>
<p>This being a route promoted for tourism, though, there was one
less-than-ideal aspect, from a running/hiking perspective: it starts and
ends at cablecar stations/restaurants/hotels at the tops of mountains.</p>
<p>An obvious feature of the route is that it's almost a loop. Further,
there are plenty of great trails between Pilatus and the Stanshorn, the
shortest of which add about 20km of distance and 1500m of climbing. I
think there are many good reasons to attempt the FKT on this variant, as
opposed to just the official trail. A loop is simpler in many ways. You
can choose any point as your start/finish and can go in either
direction. You can leave your car/gear/friends at a single location. You
don't have to worry about the timing of the cable cars (or pay for an
expensive hotel, or do extra hikes to get in and out). By closing the
loop, one also does a nice circuit around the entire western segment of
Obwalden. This canton is part of what was historical Unterwalden, one of
the three original Swiss Cantons from the first Swiss Confederation
famously founded in 1291. The Canton of Nidwalden splits Obwalden in
two, leaving Engelberg and surrounding areas in a small, Eastern part.</p>

<h2>The First Attempt</h2>
<p>I made a first attempt on the route, starting just before 6pm on
Saturday, August 22.</p>
<p>My rationale for starting at that time was to be able to do the first
half of the route in the dark and then enjoy a surge of energy as the
sun came up, propelling me through the second half and back to the train
station with plenty of time to get home. This seemed reasonable, as
it's what they do for races like the UTMB.</p>
<p>I hadn't previously run or hiked any of the route, outside of the very
first climb from Alpnachstad to Pilatus Kulm.</p>
<p>The night portion went fairly well. I made it up Pilatus in PR time and
moved quite quickly back down. After that, it was quite a miserable
experience, in many ways. I was much sleepier than I had thought I'd
be, and didn't have any caffeine except for the 20 mg in each of my
numerous gels. Cows seemed to be around every corner, forcing many
detours through muddy fields and over fences. It was a new moon, cloudy,
and drizzly at times, so the night was spent in total blackness. I ran
out of water for long periods. The long descent to the Brünigpass saw me
slow significantly, and I made it there in about 12 hours total. The
worst was that as I climbed back out of the pass and the sun finally
rose, the clouds made it far less of an energizing experience than
hoped, and my spirits didn't improve. I started to feel disoriented at
Abgschutz and was ready to give up by the time I made it to Frutt to
meet Francesco. Seeing him there, and enjoying the sandwich he got me
from the grocery store, massively raised my spirits, and we pressed on
for quite a while. However, the heat and pain in my legs eventually made
me unhappy enough to quit, at a saddle about halfway from Frutt to the
Stanserhorn. I (correctly) assumed there would be no water for a long
time on the ensuing ridge section, and I was starting to feel wobbly. We
descending back to the valley, and by the time I reached the bottom my
knees were screaming from the steep downhill on weakened legs. All told
I did about 75% of the route, in 22 hours.</p>
<p>I identified many mistakes I'd made:</p>
<ul>
<li>underestimating the effects of simply being awake for over 24 hours</li>
<li>undervaluing good food (I only took gels)</li>
<li>not having enough water capacity (one leaking \&lt;500 mL soft flask
    and one 1.5 L bag in the my pack, without a hose).</li>
</ul>
<p>Based on the experience, I decided to make some changes on the next
attempt.</p>
<ul>
<li>Prioritize "aid stations", meaning places to get Coke and "real
    food".</li>
<li>Start in the morning. Any benefits of "getting the night out of the
    way" did not offset the effects of being awake longer. I think that
    starting after sleeping, even if it's only for a couple of hours,
    is almost always a good idea.</li>
<li>Because of the previous two points, start at the Brünigpass, the
    midpoint of the official route, so that I could do the unscouted
    section in daylight, refuel in Alpnach, and then repeat the known
    night time portion.</li>
<li>Get some better water storage and carry more</li>
<li>Carry more, and tastier, food</li>
<li>Get some electrolyte tabs</li>
</ul>
<p>I finally caved and replaced my broken soft flask and hydration bladder
with two new 500 mL soft flasks and a 1.5 L bladder. I got myself some
fizzy electrolyte tablets, some peanut M+M's, and some gummy bears.</p>
<h2>The Second Attempt</h2>
<p>Armed with my lessons learned, I hoped for another weekend with good
conditions. Two weeks later seemed good, but I didn't feel recovered.</p>
<p>Three weeks later, fortunately, had even better weather. This is
probably the best time of year for hiking (in Switzerland, as in
California), as it's getting cooler but not cold, the days aren't too
short yet, the ground is relatively dry, and the weather becomes stable.</p>
<p>After some delicious pasta from Clara the night before, I took the first
train on Saturday morning from Zurich to the Brünig-Hasliberg station,
which would be my starting and finishing point.</p>

</div> <!--grid-item-->
<p>I started at 8:07 and began jogging in the lovely cool morning. This
part had been in the dark, the previous time, and it was interesting to
see how different things looked. Throughout the whole route, I would be
noticing and avoiding all the places I'd taken a wrong turn,
previously. With daylight, one could usually just see a red and white
marker in the distance.</p>
<p>I focused on making steady progress and enjoyed the scenery. I passed a
spot which had been a (mental) low point before, where'd I'd sat down
on the ground for a few minutes, just as it was starting to get light. I
progressed up to Älggi-Alp and fairly efficiently to the Abgschutz,
taking in the excellent view.</p>

<p>I went fairly slowly for a while as I digested and moved into endless
a-little-less-than-good trails. This section felt very difficult, again,
even though I was fresh. A lot of the trails seemed to be half rocks,
half cow-mangled mud.</p>

<p>I was trying to stay on the "official" route, which I'd defined as
the green line on my SwissMobility app, and as such I wasted a lot of
time and energy doing some heinous bushwhacking. After I'd been pushing
through dense trees for a while I decided that the trail had obviously
been re-routed, and I think it's totally fair for any attempt on this
route to follow what are very clearly marked improvements to the trail.</p>

<figcaption>Here, and at one ridge before the Sattelpass, I tried to stay on the official track from SchweizMobil, even though the trail had been re-routed, with extremely obvious markings. For anyone going for this FKT, in my opinion it's completely valid to take the new trails (red line), as opposed to bushwhacking (green line with red dots).</figcaption>

<p>Soon enough I reached the bail point from last time. The big difference
this time was that I had 2L of water and some snacks I actually wanted
to eat. It was a great feeling to continue on the trail, which was a
very steep but beautifully-groomed climb through the trees, depositing
me onto an incredible ridge section. I felt really terrible for denying
this to Francesco last time, as it was brochure-level trail running.

ridge, with clouds blowing up from the right. No cows up here!</p>

<p>On the first climb, I felt some hot spots developing on my toes, so
stopped for a pack-off, sit-down break. I have never used electrolyte
tabs before, so I didn't realize how fragile they were - I just put
them in a bag with the peanut M+M's and now discovered that a) they
were almost entirely pulverized b) peanut M+M's covered in fizzy
electrolyte dust are delicious! This wasn't actually much of a problem,
in the end, as enough moisture got into the bag to re-clump the dust
into pieces which could be dropped into a water bottle.</p>

<p>Moving through one notch required some fixed ropes, on a section steep
enough that I actually had to turn around and hand-over-hand the rope -
the footholds were big and good, but a bit wet.</p>

<p>Somewhere around here I reached the marathon point, which was
appropriate, as it was approximately when my friend Pratyush finished
running his marathon in Maryland. I did mine in 7:45 or so, so he went
over twice as fast! But it's not fair to compare, as he had pacers.</p>

<p>I began to be glad I'd bailed the previous time, as despite the
absolutely epic scenery, I didn't run into any water (though I did
notice an alp below at one point, which may have been an option if
desperate). It was great to see the Stanserhorn come into view, but the
trail down to it was one of the steep, root-choked affairs that can make
things slow going. Surprisingly, I didn't find any obvious water
sources on the trail going through Äscherli, but I did manage to get
about 400 mL out of a cow drinking fountain, by fitting my soft flasks
over the nozzle. I figured that would be enough to get me up the
Stanserhorn.</p>

<p>The lower part of the climb was quite flat, and the actual ascent was
confined to one very steep section of 300m or so. That was good because
this was one of the low points of the day. It became humid in the late
afternoon, and I sweat so much as to soak all of my clothes. I'm proud
that I kept going upwards at my snail's pace, and thankfully it was a
short enough climb that i didn't lose too much time before arriving at
the flat trail around the summit. I shuffled to the cable car station
and got myself a 500 mL Coke in the self-service restaurant. I sat in a
bit of stupor, observed by the well-dressed rich people, as I drank
(good, but too cold and fizzy, as it came out of a soda fountain). I
filled my water up in the bathroom, lamented that I wasn't able to use
the "real" facilities, and started the descent.</p>
<p>I felt much better on the way down as things cooled off, and enjoyed the
fast section heading back towards the notch. It felt nice at this point
to know that I was now finding my own route until the summit of Pilatus.
Since I was trying to set an OKT, I couldn't deviate from the official
trail, but now there wasn't one, so anything that got me where I was
going was fine! I followed the red and white trail down, and then took
various yellow trails, opting to avoid climbing in favor of a less
direct route to Alpnach, arriving at the south end of town. It had now
been a little under 12 hours. I didn't feel too bad about it, as the
route to this point had not been all nice trails, but I had to admit
that I was almost certainly not going to finish the route in 24 hours,
as the remaining portion had taken about 12 hours on the previous
attempt, and I had moved quite quickly going up and down Pilatus.</p>
<p>Alpnach is not a big place, but I'd expected it to have all I'd need,
namely a restaurant where I could quickly get some hot food, and a
convenience store at the train station where I could resupply with
enough snacks to get me through the night. I'd been so sure I
remembered there being a Kiosk convenience store at the station that I
assumed that the picture on Google Streetview, which showed the
restaurant there instead, was outdated, as sometimes happens - plugging
in the restaurant's address did indeed show somewhere else, nearby.
However, I arrived and there was the restaurant, just like on Streeview!
Only as a write this have I deduced that I was remembering the <em>Sarnen</em>
train station, where we got off the bus, post-bailage, three weeks
before.</p>
<p>I could tell I wasn't popular with the server. In retrospect, fair,
seeing as I'm sure I smelled like a garbage barge. From briefly looking
at the website beforehand, I had expected a takeaway place, given that
it was open until 1 am, served cheap (by Swiss standards) burgers and
fries and was called "McOne" (lol), but it was set up more like a
sit-down restaurant/bar. I asked to sit outside but she didn't want me
taking up a whole 4-top, so had to sit inside, which was maybe safer
since no one else was in there.</p>

<p>I had to pay with cash, but this was okay as I could immediately feed
almost all the coins (heavy!) into the vending machine at the train
station (since the Kiosk I'd been expecting didn't exist) in exchange
for Snickers and Twix.</p>
<p>I reflected on how when I first arrived in Switzerland, I couldn't have
told you there was a big difference between the big cities and the small
towns, as it all seemed to foreign. But now it's much more clear that
there are divides, just as everywhere.</p>
<p>I started the hike up Pilatus without my headlamp, relying on the light
of the town below and the simple surface of the bottom part of the
trail. I concentrated on efficient progress but tried to avoid pushing
too hard, not wanting to sweat too much. This was perhaps the morale
lowpoint of the route. I was only halfway done, I was miserably sweating
on the humid lower part of the mountain, and all I could think about was
all the hardships coming up. 3 hours of walking up this trail, then a
whole series of sections that I remembered all to well, all punctuated
by surprise detours to get around cows. So many cows.</p>
<p>I tried as hard as I could to focus on the short term goals, the first
of which was simply thinking that with every step, I gained altitude,
and thus cooler temperatures, less humidity, and more wind as I would
escape the trees. I had also surprisingly not passed any water fountains
in Alpnach and had had to resort to buying a bottle from the vending
machine at the Alpnachstad train station. I was now out again and was
greatly looking forward to two sources I knew on the climb. The first,
not really for humans but which I've used before, was blocked by cows
so I kept on, knowing there was another option soon. My heart dropped a
little when I reached the second one, in Ämsigen, and saw it wasn't
running, the trough empty. This was the last one I knew about for at
least 2-3 hours. As is almost never the case, though, there was handle
on the spigot, and turning it worked! Phew.</p>
<p>As it would turn out, though there were quite a few cows here, low on
Pilatus, but on the rest of the route there were far fewer, and none
that blocked the whole trail as had happened so many times on the
previous attempt. I think the 3 weeks made a big difference, at the end
of the summer. I heard more cows inside barns, and I suspect some had
been moved lower down. There were also markings for an upcoming
e-mountain bike race, so it's possible that some fields had been
cleared in preparation.</p>
<p>As I continued up, I passed a group of people camping right along the
trail. They said something to me and I replied "Schöner
Campingplatz!", which they laughed at. Even though I try with German,
in Switzerland the first thing anyone says to you is usually in one of
the many dialects of Swiss German, so most interactions begin with a
misunderstanding.</p>
<p>I crept up the last switchbacks to Pilatus Kulm. It was about 23:30 when
I arrived there, and someone came out of the hotel, probably having seen
my headlamp and wondering if I was in trouble. In typical polite Swiss
fashion, though, he just said good evening in some sort of German, I
responded the same, and then he went back inside. I checked to make sure
I went to the official start of route 57 (the cable car station), and
then began the descent. I wasn't feeling wonderful, but I knew things
were looking up, as in some sense it was now about running out the
clock. Bailing and quitting were not so different, now (which is a good
thing if you're not in any danger), and all I really had to do was keep
moving, eating, and drinking, and the remaining kilometers and hours of
darkness would continue to disappear.</p>
<p>The night is more of a blur, but thankfully I had already made all the
wrong turns on the previous attempt, so the task of staying on course
while tired was far less stressful. I played it very safe with water,
filling up to 2L whenever possible. A low point last time had been the
Schlierengrat, a long, slow ridge section in a root-filled, sometimes
muddy, never-a-constant-grade single track. There is no water on the
ridge, as you would expect, but then surprisingly little to be found for
a long period afterwards (though there is a stream at Schwendi Kaltbad
which, in retrospect, I should have used on the first attempt). This
time, I had made very sure to have enough water, but my headlamp dimmed
significantly - I'm sure it did on the first attempt, as well, but I
had gotten further along to where it wasn't so obvious. The low light
in combination with tired legs and uneven trail made this section
interminable. My phone was my backup lamp, which I should have switched
to earlier, but I was anxious about wasting the battery too much. I
actually shouldn't have been, since after switching to it for the
descent from the ridge and looking at the drain rate, it (a couple of
years old iPhone 8) had a least 2-3 hours in it, and I also carried a
backup battery which could have mostly recharged it. I didn't want to
dip too much into that reserve since I needed at least a little bit of
it to recharge my GPS watch (Suunto Ambit 3 Peak) on the go - a single
charge there only lasts about 17 hours unless you want to sacrifice GPS
polling rate. I really didn't want my watch to die, as the GPS track is
an essential part of verifying an FKT. There is a nice viewpoint on the
ridge, where I stopped for a few minutes, lying down and looking at the
stars, which is something I haven't done for a while. I felt very cold
when I got up, but I am glad I stopped for at least a bit to appreciate
being in a beautiful place, even though my main objective was to move
quickly through it.</p>
<p>On the way down, nature finally called. In getting my pack on and off, I
managed to accidentally pause my watch, so didn't track for a couple of
kilometers before noticing after Glaubenberg (my proposed ad campaign:
"Glaubenberg: Believe it! [picture of person in helmet having great
time on some sort of ropes course]"). This also meant that I didn't
track the little extra jaunt I did because I forgot my poles and had to
go back for them.</p>
<p>The rest of the route wasn't too bad, and the sun coming up at about 6
was beautiful. This time, the weather was clear, so I got the
spirits-lifting sunrise I'd been hoping for. I also busted out the
secret weapon (headphones) at around this point. I always have tiny
loops of songs going around and around in my head during these
endeavors, and some of them were pretty irritating this time, as they
leaned a lot in the novelty direction. There was a lot of the Pistol
Annies which, as pop country, is somewhere between fun and obnoxious.

<p>I was happy that I continued to do much better eating and drinking. I
found that with my ample water supply, I could put some Snickers or gel
in my mouth, and then take a sip of water, which made everything much

more pleasant to get down.</p>

<p>Getting to Glaubenbielen was a big boost, as it meant one more big
climb, and then the descent. I pushed hard on the first part of the
climb (probably too hard) and I ate plenty of candy. I lost some time to
getting tangled up trying to recharge my phone on the go, as the
music-playing was draining it faster now, and I didn't want to lose the
map or camera. I slowed quite a lot near the top, losing more time to
another natural call. Crossing the notch put me in the full sun,
suddenly, and I made the mistake of waiting until I finished the climb
to put on sunscreen and my hat. It was great to see this section in the
daytime, as the trail goes on a spectacular knife edge - if you
continued on it, you would get to the Hardergrat, which is a well-known
hike for a good reason. I finally arrived at a creepy wooden statue
which marks the start of the descent. I took a few minutes to swap into
daytime gear, get the rocks out of my shoes for the descent, and take
pictures of the great vista over Lake Brienz, with 4000m peaks visible
to the south.</p>

<p>The 1000m descent was slow and painful. My legs were feeling quite shot,
so I just did what I could to get down. I have zero idea of how, but at
some point on the descent my watch completely stopped. This requires
three button presses with two different buttons, so it seems unlikely to
happen by accident, even in an exhausted state. I saw an elevation
profile displayed which gave me some hope that it had saved the track so
far, but I was not very happy now that I was unsure about this - part of
the objective had been to establish an OKT, for which a GPS track is
required. I started a new recording for the remaining 4km or so and
tried not to think about it too much, which wasn't difficult as getting
to stop was going to be a sweet reward.</p>
<p>At least I didn't lose the trail, as I had more than once on the
previous attempt in the dark. Finally, I arrived back at the road and
slowly jogged the sidewalks back to my starting point at the train
station. I finished at 10:42, for a total of 26:35 (1d 2h 35m).</p>

<p>I estimate the distance at 125.6 km with 7575 m of climbing. I hit the
24 hour mark somewhere on the last, \~500m climb, so this is a PR for me
for climbing in day.</p>
<p>Sitting down was incredible. Not running anymore is truly one of the
most rewarding parts of running.</p>

<h2>Plans and Lessons Learned</h2>
<p>I don't really have many concrete future objectives, yet (though I'm
sure ideas will come, as usual, once I forget the pain). I'm a tiny bit
worried about my knees (more than usual steep downhill in the last month
or two, some of it on very tired legs), so I will probably try and baby
them for a while. Speaking of which, we're expecting a real baby soon,
so I should be realistic in how much time I'll have to traipse around
the hills all weekend. My original plan for this summer, pre-pandemic,
had been to enter some races, in the hopes of running a hard 100-mile
race next year, comparable to the UTMB. This loop was, by the numbers,
similar to 3/4 of a UTMB (120 km, 7500m of climbing, roughly 500m-2000m
elevations, as opposed to 1000-2500m). This makes me feel that it would
be possible to train for a race like that, but also puts into
perspective how long it is - to me the most daunting of the many
daunting statistics is the 40 hour average time to complete it.</p>
<p>As of now I'm thinking I will return to some general training as I can
fit it in, perhaps taking the chance to focus more specifically on
speed, muscular endurance, and core strength, and look for a race to
enter next year.</p>
<p>Lessons learned, which I find useful to write down, to be able to look
back on later:</p>
<ul>
<li>The M+M's, gummy bears, and electrolyte tabs were all fantastic to
    have. The tabs unexpectedly had a lot of caffeine (75 mg per), which
    was very helpful in the night.</li>
<li>For a long time, I think I've been confusing overheating with
    dehydration. They both apparently make me feel very thirsty. I
    realized this, finally, on the ascent of the Stanserhorn, sweating
    through every piece of clothing in the surprising humidity. The
    realization didn't seem so obvious, since overheating can cause
    dehydration (sweat more) and be caused by dehydration (can't sweat
    enough). However, the distinction explains how I can drink so much
    water and still not feel any better. I've been in that state on
    almost every recent long route, so it's good to know that
    slowing/cooling down is the immediate fix, and that I'm not
    necessarily dehydrated (yet).</li>
<li>Also on the water front, I think I've learned to carry more when
    self-/unsupported. Especially in Switzerland, it's very easy to
    think you'll always find water "soon". Many times I thought to
    myself that I was wasting energy by carrying so much - I rarely had
    less than a liter in my pack on this route. But, I drained the whole
    2+ liter supply more than once, including times when I had not
    expected to and on segments I had already run, because water troughs
    dry up or get turned off (or get blocked by cows, as happened on
    Pilatus). I also consciously took opportunities to refill even if
    they weren't ideal, like a fountain running slowly or a little bit
    off the route. There are no aid stations and having a reserve is
    worth its weight in water.</li>
<li>Eating and drinking are a main factor. Before a route like this, you
    probably know that you can do it, in terms of "Are my
    lungs/muscles/joints/etc. strong enough?". What's less sure is
    whether you're going to be able to get in enough water and calories
    to supply those muscles, and equally importantly to supply your
    brain with enough energy to maintain the will to continue, making
    good decisions.</li>
<li>Intentionally keeping yourself happy is also a main factor. Part of
    persevering on a route like this is knowing, from experience, that
    low points won't last forever, and that you should just keep going.
    The low point for me, in terms of motivation, was starting the climb
    up Pilatus. The prospect of a night, alone, with no good food or
    other people, skirting cows and mud, really got me down as I
    remembered so many portions of the previous attempt and thought
    (incorrectly) that this would have to be a strictly worse experience
    than that, because now I was doing it after moving all day, instead
    of resting. I forced myself to focus on short term, positive things
    (at first, just that the higher I got, the cooler it would be).</li>
