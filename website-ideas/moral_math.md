Moral Mathematics

When I was young, I had an idea that universal truth existed.
I think almost all of us did.

I thought that about matters of right and wrong, certainly.
I also though it about things like mathematics.

But in about my second year of college, I took a course on the foundations of mathematics,
and what I learned was this:
everything is based on an assumption.

There's no way around it. At some point, every line of reasoning, every system
of beliefs, every mathematical proof, every political movement, all scientific
knowledge, all technology, boils down to "we hold these truths to be self
evident". Assume that X.

On one hand, that's terrifying! It's all just made up!

But if you stop and look at the world around you, it's also quite heartening.
We agree on a lot. Our assumptions are often pretty good.  You can USE these
things, even though apparently they have no justification other than the fact
that several of us agreed that they seemed about right.


Most people don't seem to have any problem accepting the idea of mathematical
axioms. It's probably because most people don't think about it much. Similarly,
most engineers have no problem assuming certain things to be true about physics
(or whatever scientific discipline informs their work), because those
assumptions work.


Where it gets messy is political and moral/ethical belief.

People don't like to think about what their moral and political axioms are.

But I think it's a very valuable thing to think about, for two reasons.

1. Finding common ground. If you dig down, most people's fundamental values
   aren't so different.

2. Seeing the difference between hypocrisy and good faith. Sometimes you
   disagree with someone because they really have a fundamental difference in
   their assumptions. But sometimes, you disagree with them because they have
   fundamental conflicts in their own axioms, and refuse to admit it. This
   usually suggests a hidden axiom, which they may not even admit to themselves
   that they have (especially if it's something like being racist, selfish, or
   power-hungry)
