It would be great to submit a crossword the NYT.

1. Several articles mention common tools and how they're used: https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/11/crosswords/how-to-make-crossword-puzzle-grid.html

1. Word lists https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/13/crosswords/how-to-make-a-crossword-fill.html?action=click&module=RelatedLinks&pgtype=Article

I like something where the key clues are puns
that include an English word that is also a German word meaning something different

(Also see my bilingual crossword generator script)

"Gut feeling"
"Gift horse"
"Toll booth"
"Bad egg"

Kind
Fall
Duster
Heft
Mist
...

Database of all former clues? (build your own fill, use figuring out the algorithm as
a programming interview question)
