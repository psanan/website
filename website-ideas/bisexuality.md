When I was a kid, I used to come home from school and watch TV, most afternoons,
while my parents were at work. Mostly I remember watching Nickelodeon, Comedy Central,
The Simpsons, and Friends.

One scene in Friends which stuck in my brain was from ["The One After the Superbowl (Part 1)"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_One_After_the_Superbowl)
Phoebe sings a song in the coffee shop, going

   Sometimes men love women
   and sometimes men love men
   and then there are bisexuals
   but some just say they're kidding themselves

Here it is on YouTube:

This was in 1996, a time when I believe that there were lots and lots
of young non-straight people who had never even *heard* of another non-straight person,
who didn't even know that was a thing, and were tortured by feelings they
couldn't connect to the the experience of other people.

That's just to say that, though the treatment of LGBTQ+ people on TV in the 90s
is cringeworthy in a lot of ways, now, I'm probably on the side of giving it a pass
as a worthwhile increment.

Later, I started reading and listening to Dan Savage, and up until maybe 10 years ago,
he'd often state what I assume was a common opinion at the time, that
male and female sexuality were different in the sense that females were more
"fluid" and men more "rigid". Men were either straight or gay, but women kinda
osillated with the moon or whatever.

I also  learned from Savage that "bisexual," in the gay community at the time,
was essentially code for "gay but still not ready to fully admit it".

This is the environment I grew up in.

I am bisexual, but not in the way alluded to above. I'm more bisexual in the way
that Charles M. Blow is (though as I'll discuss later, "bisexual" is almost as
hard a term to pin down as "god").

So what happened? Well, to oversimplify, I think that in the mid-90s, if you were
a gay man you could reasonably fear being fired, ostracized, assaulted, or murdered.
If you were a lesbian you could fear some of that, but my impression (as someone
who outside the community who wasn't old enough at the time to really know),
is that you could fear some social consequences, but you probably weren't seriously
worried that any given group of straight chicks was looking for an opportunity
to beat the shit out of you. On top of that, straight male culture was
(to once again quote Dan Savage) defined by not being a woman and not being a f--
Whatever it was you were supposed to be (unclear), you sure as hell weren't
supposed to be into dudes.

So, the culture accepted female bisexuality in a way it did not accept male bisexuality.
You could be a straight woman who had kissed another woman, hell who had slept with
women in college. This was even considered attractive. But to be a straight man meant
1000% straight, otherwise you were 1000% gay. Thus, bisexual men like me, who aren't
deeply troubled by being perceived as and acting straight, didnt' come out.
The "bisexual" guys were largely the ones who couldn't hide, because it was
antithetical to their true identities.

This has all changed in the last 20 years. I think that, as with a lot of things,
what was talked about as a fundamental difference between the sexes turns out
to be a gender construct. I think men are just as bisexual as women.

Nowadays, in fact, people are attacking the "bi" part of it. I think that's good,
because "bisexual" is almost a useless term. If it means having the slightest
attraction, in life or in fantasy, to anyone who doesn't fit the perfect definition
of the opposite gender from the one you identify as, well then I warrant that almost
everyone is bisexual. On the other hand, if it means that you make absolutely no
distinction based on sex or gender when it comes to sexual and romantic attraction -
it's as insignificant as hair color - then that probably describes a small subset
of the bisexual population.

So, in the interst of making things "as simple as possible, but no simpler",
how should I think about this? I like (again, Dan Savage) the idea of the three-layer
cake of orientation: what you tell people about who you sleep with, who you want to sleep with, and who you actually sleep with.
The more aligned these layers are, the more self-actualized you are, but no one has perfect alignment,
and the layers can move around during your life. I'm not sure if there analogy holds
when you start assigning sizes to the layers.

The first layer of that is basically the ad you're showing to the world.
For me, that's "heteroflexible". I'm in a monogamish relationship with a woman,
I find myself mostly attracted to women, but I do also find men attractive
and am open to sleeping with them.  Who do I want to sleep with?
I think that aligns with the "ad": heteroflexible. Who do I sleep with?
Well, right now, no one, because we just had a baby :D (Just kidding, but I'm
now entitled to make dad jokes. But I only sleep with my wife - maybe someday
some other people, but no time or energy now).

I would add an addendum to this cake metaphor: next to that big old three-tired wedding cake is a plate of wacky little cupcakes.
They don't have to align with anything - they're for fun and you can put whatever the hell you want on top of them.
This is who you fantasize about having sex with.
Here, I'm certainly pansexual: the best part about fantasy is that it's unlimited.
I think another aspect to being self-actualized is to enjoy fantasy for its own sake.
Probably most (old-enough) people can relate to the fact that some things you fantasize about
because you deeply want them to happen in real life, and some things you fantasize
about just because they are fun to fantasize about. God grant me the wisdom to tell the
difference, etc.

So, why write this? My sex life has nothing to do with most of you reading this.
First, simply because I wish I'd heard this viewpoint expressed by others,
and the Golden Rule applies. I wasn't tortured by being bisexual (because by a roll of the dice, the defaults assigned
to me based on my sex allow me to feel like me). But I was confused, and had that
horrible feeling that there is something about you that you don't hear echoed
in other people's (expressed) experiences, and don't have words to express. That
makes you feel isolated and scared. I only felt this occasionally, but extrapolating
to the case of someone who's entire sexual identity felt that way is truly heartbreaking.
Second, because coming out works: knowing someone with identity X radically changes
the way you feel about identity X. It's now normal, part of the real world, whereas before
it was a theoretical (and often politicized) abstraction.
