An entire blog (or series of posts) dedicated to celebrating my favorite trip reports.



Googling for that brings up a horribly different thing - "travel blogs", so I should specify what I am after.
Writing:

- By the person who did the trip or event being described
- By someone who did it not knowing if they would succeed (which was a big part of the point)
- Usually some physical expedition or challenge: running, climbing, biking, caving, etc.
- The type of thing that compels nerds like me to write and read these stories, basically.
- Being written on a gross-looking low-tech web 1.0 blog is a big plus.
