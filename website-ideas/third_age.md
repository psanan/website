1. We live in a very exciting time. Only the biggest things in human history compare. The first would be whatever allowed us to become social. The next might be the agricultural revolution when exponential growth started . Now we have covered the planet and exponential growth is stopping. That's absolutely amazing .

There's an analogy explored in my music about this being the third age of life. The long "adult" part, where you're not a child, not in that explosive part where you become who you are and make your mistakes and grow up. But the next part.
