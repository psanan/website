Inspired by Jonathan Blow's langauge ("jai" at the moment),
or something like Go. That is, languages built out of dissatisfaction
within a particular field with the popular language (C++) that
they've been using.

If I were writing a language, what would it be?
I am not seriously proposing to write one,
but this will hopefully clarify what is a good programming practice and what isn't.

I like many of Blow's ideas:
- Simplicity of concept is key. Don't introduce abstractions unless you really, really need them.
- Like C, keep it close to how computers actualy work. That is, blocks of memory, and sequential instructions.
- Make it fun!

So what's the domain? Let's say it's what I always want to do, but rarely can, which is
quickly write experimental audiovisual code. To be able to build things and use them.

Building huge applications isn't a concern.

What exists and what's wrong with it?

- Max, Pd, Ableton, etc.: Too far from what a computer does, too GUI-focused (But as with Jai, being able to edit "in game" via a GUI is also essential!)
- SuperCollider: obscure language, hard to debug
- Processing: Java junk, too many concessions to people who can't code
- C sound etc. Too low level and ancient
