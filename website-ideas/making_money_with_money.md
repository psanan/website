The way that people in "finance" make money is not so much
by making smart investments - that's the impression they'd like
to give, so that you give them money.

However, the real strategy is simply to find somewhere where large
amounts of money are moving, and extract a percentage. It's the
same way being a realtor works. This is clearly the good strategy
because you're not exposed to risk - you convince other people
that they need to move money around, and when they do so,
win or lose, you win.
