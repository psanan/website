1. In defense of traditional musical notation. It's annoying, but not quite that crazy. Always seemed cruel to have different bass and treble clefs, but. Bass clef is just an extended treble clef! Line up the C's and keep going. you can think of it as one invisible line between the clefs and then more permanent lines. G and F are marked on this super staff. Also note the symmetry of the C's. Everything with the crazy sharps and flats is so that if you're in a given key, the scales in the 7 modes are  one line (hence base note name) for each of the 7 degrees.
